## 🎯 Interview Talking Points

### Technical Questions You Can Answer:

**Q: Tell me about this project.**
> "AutoQuery is an AI chatbot that lets users upload documents and ask questions about them. I built it using React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. The system uses OpenAI's GPT-4 for responses and FAISS for efficient document search."

**Q: How does document search work?**
> "When users upload a document, I extract the text and split it into chunks. Each chunk is converted to a vector embedding using OpenAI's embedding model and stored in FAISS. When users ask questions, I perform similarity search to find relevant chunks and send them to GPT-4 for context-aware answers."

**Q: Why did you choose this tech stack?**
> "I chose React with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience. FastAPI because it's fast, modern, and perfect for AI projects. LangChain simplified the document processing pipeline, and FAISS provides efficient vector search."

**Q: What was the biggest challenge?**
> "Balancing document chunk size to maintain context while keeping searches fast. Also handling different document formats and ensuring reliable text extraction from PDFs."
