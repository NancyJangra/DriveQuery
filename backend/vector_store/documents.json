In some areas,\nthe only fuels that are available are oxy-\ngenated fuels.\nOxygenated fuels whic h meet the mini-\nmum octane requirement and the require-\nments described below may be used in\nyour vehicle without jeopardizing the New\nVehicle Limited Warranty.\nNOTE:\nOxygenated fuels are fuels which containoxygen-carrying additives such as MTBE\nor alcohol.Gasoline Containing MTBE\nUnleaded gasoline containing MTBE\n(methyl tertiary butyl ether) may be used in\nyour vehicle if the MTBE content is not\ngreater than 15%. This oxygenated fueldoes not contain alcohol.\nGasoline/Ethanol blends\nBlends of unleaded gasoline and ethanol\n(grain alcohol), also known as gasohol,\nmay be used in your vehicle if the ethanolcontent is not greater than 10%.\nGasoline/Methanol blends\nFuels containing 5% or less methanol\n(wood alcohol) may be suitable for use in\nyour vehicle if they contain cosolvents andcorrosion inhibitors. Do NOT USE fuels\ncontaining more than 5% methanol under\nany circumstances. Fuel system damageor vehicle performance problems resulting\nfrom the use of such fuels are not the\nresponsibility of SUZUKI and may not becovered under the New Vehicle Limited\nWarranty.Fuel Pump Labeling\nIn some states, pumps that dispense oxy-\ngenated fuels are required to be labeled for\nthe type and percentage of oxygenate and\nwhether important additives are present.Such labels may provide enough informa-\ntion for you to determine if a particular\nblend of fuel meets the requirements listedabove. In other areas, pumps may not be\nclearly labeled as to the content or type of\noxygenate and additives. If you are notsure that the fuel you intend to use meets\nthese requirements, check with the service\nstation operator or the fuel supplier.\nNOTE:\nTo help clean the air, SUZUKI recom-mends you use the oxygenated fuels.\nHowever, if you are not satisfied with the\ndriveability or fuel economy of your vehiclewhen you are using an oxygenated fuel,\nswitch back to the regular unleaded gaso-\nline.\nCAUTION\nBe careful not to sp ill fuel containing\nalcohol while refuel ing. If fuel is\nspilled on the vehicle body, wipe it up\nimmediately. Fuels containing alco-\nhol can cause paint damage, which is\nnot covered under the New Vehicle\nLimited Warranty.Fuel Recommendation: 1, 2\nBEFORE DRIVING\n2\n79K21-03E60G404BEFORE DRIVING\nKeys ......................................................................................2-1\nDoor Locks ..........................................................................2-1Keyless Start System Remote  Controller/Keyless Entry \nSystem Transmitter .............................................................2-4Theft Deterrent Light ...........................................................2-15Windows ..............................................................................2-15\nMirrors ..................................................................................2-17\nFront Seats ..........................................................................2-18Rear Seats ............................................................................2-22\nSeat Belts and Child Restraint Systems ...........................2-26\nSupplemental Restraint System (air bags) .......................2-43Instrument Cluster ..............................................................2-54\nWarning and Indicator Lights ............................................2-55\nSpeedometer .......................................................................2-65Tachometer ..........................................................................2-65\nFuel Gauge ...........................................................................2-65\nTemperature Gauge ............................................................2-66Brightness Control ..............................................................2-66\nInformation Display (if equipped) ......................................2-67\nLighting Control Lever ........................................................2-75Front Fog Light Switch (if equipped) ................................2-78\nTurn Signal Control Lever ..................................................2-78\nHazard Warning Switch ......................................................2-79Windshield Wiper and Washer L ever .......... ......................2-79\nTilt Steering Lock Lever .....................................................2-82Horn ......................................................................................2-82Rear Window Defroster and Outside Rearview Mirrors \nDefroster (if equipped) Switch ...........................................2-82\n2-1BEFORE DRIVING\n79K21-03EKeys\n54G489\nYour vehicle comes with a pair of identical\nkeys.

Whenever possible, SUZUKI recom-mends you install child  r e s t r a i n t s  i n  t h e\nrear seat.\nThe front passenger sensing system is\ndesigned to enable the front passenger\u2019sfront air bag when the system senses a\nproperly-seated adult in the front passen-\nger\u2019s seat. When the passenger sensingsystem has allowed the air bag to be\nenabled, the \u201cPASS AI R BAG OFF\u201d indica-\ntor will remain off to remind you that the air\nbag is active.\nIf a person of adult size is sitting in the\nfront passenger\u2019s seat and the \u201cPASS AIR\nBAG OFF\u201d indicator comes on, it could be\nbecause that person isn\u2019t sitting properly inthe seat. If this happens, unfasten the seat\nbelts, sit upright in the center of the seat\nwith the seatback nearly vertical and yourlegs outstretched, and refasten the seat\nbelt.\n52D258\nWhen seated as shown in the above illus-tration, the front passenger sensing sys-\ntem senses a properly-seated occupantand enables the air bag.\nWhen using a seat belt extender, follow the\ninstructions in the \u201cSeat Belt Extender\u201d\nsection.WARNING\nDo not install a rear-facing child\nrestraint in the front passenger\u2019sseat. If the passenger\u2019s front air bag\ninflates, a child in a rear-facing child\nrestraint could be seriously injured.The back of a rear-facing child\nrestraint would be too close to the\ninflating air bag.\nWARNING\nDo not place any heavy objects on\nthe front passenger\u2019s seat. The pres-\nsure sensors in the sensor mat couldbe damaged and the front passenger\nsensing system may not work prop-\nerly.\n2-51BEFORE DRIVING\n79K21-03EHow the System Works\nIn a frontal collision, the crash sensors will\ndetect rapid deceleration and send a signal\nto the controller. If the controller judges\nthat the deceleration represents a severefrontal crash, the cont roller will trigger the\ninflators. The controller also judges:\u007f Whether the front air bags should deploy\nat reduced power or at full power accord-\ning to crash severity.\n\u007f Whether the front passenger\u2019s front air\nbag should deploy or not based on clas-sification of the occupant of the front\npassenger\u2019s seat.\nSince your vehicle is equipped with side airbags, and side curtain air bags, crash sen-sors will detect a side collision, and if the\ncontroller judges that the side collision is\nsevere enough, it will trigger the side airbag and side curtain air bag inflators.\nYour vehicle also has rollover sensors that\nwork with the controller to predict whether\na rollover may occur and if the controller\njudges that a severe rollover is about tooccur, it triggers the side curtain air bag\ninflators on both sides of the vehicle.\nThe inflators inflate the appropriate air\nbags with nitrogen or argon gas. The\ninflated air bags provide a cushion for yourhead (front air bags and side curtain air\nbags only) and upper body. The air bag\ninflates and deflates so quickly that youmay not even realize that it has activated.WARNING\nThe front passen ger sensing system\nmay not work properly in the follow-ing situations:\n\u007f The occupant is sitting near the\ndashboard or is not sitting in the\nproper position.\n\u007f Objects placed under the seat are\npushing up on the seat cushion.\nWARNING\nIf the \u201cPASS AIR BAG OFF\u201d indicatoron the instrument  panel turns on\neven though there is no occupant oran adult occupant in the front pas-\nsenger\u2019s seat, it means that some-\nthing may be wrong with the\npassenger sensing system. Have thesystem inspected by an authorized\nSUZUKI dealer as soon as possible.WARNING\n\u007f Do not spill any liquids on the seat.\nLiquids can damage the sensors\nunder the front seat.\n\u007f Have front passenger\u2019s sensor mat\ninspected by your dealer after acollision.\n\u007f Do not replace the front seats. If\nyou replace them, the air bags andfront passenger sensing system\nmay not work properly.\n\u007f Do not use a seat cover. If you use\na seat cover, the front passengersensing system may not work prop-\nerly.\n2-52BEFORE DRIVING\n79K21-03EThe air bag will neither hinder your view\nnor make it harder to exit the vehicle.\nAir bags must inflate quickly and forcefully\nin order to reduce the chance of serious or\nfatal injuries. However, an unavoidableconsequence of the quick inflation is that\nthe air bag may irritate bare skin, such as\nthe facial area against a front air bag. Also,upon inflation, a loud noise will occur and\nsome powder and smoke will be released.\nThese conditions are not harmful and donot indicate a fire in  the car. Be aware,\nhowever, that some air bag componentsmay be hot for a while after inflation.\nA seat belt helps keep you in the proper\nposition for maximum protection when anair bag inflates. Adjust your seat as far\nback as possible while still maintaining\ncontrol of the vehicle. Sit fully back in yourseat; sit up straight; do not lean over the\nsteering wheel or dashboard. Front occu-\npants should not lean on or sleep againstthe door. Please refer to the \u201cSeat Adjust-\nment\u201d section and the \u201cSeat Belts and\nChild Restraint Systems\u201d section in the\u201cBEFORE DRIVING\u201d section for details on\nproper seat and seat belt adjustments.65D610\n54G582\nWARNING\n\u007f The driver should not lean over the\nsteering wheel. The front passen-\nger should not rest his or her body\nagainst the dashbo ard, or other-\nwise get too close to the dash-\nboard. For vehicles with side air\nbags and side curtain air bags,\noccupants should not lean on orsleep against the door. In these sit-\nuations, the out-o f-position occu-\npant would be too close to an\ninflating air bag, and may suffer\nsevere injury.\n\u007f Do not attach any objects to, or\nplace any objects o ver, the steering\nwheel or dashboard. Do not place\nany objects between the air bagand the driver or front passenger.\nThese objects may in terfere with air\nbag operation or may be propelled\nby the air bag in the event of a\ncrash. Either of these conditions\nmay cause severe injury.\n(Continued)\n2-53BEFORE DRIVING\n79K21-03ENote that even though your vehicle may be\nmoderately damaged in a collision, the col-lision may not have been severe enough to\ntrigger the front, side, or side curtain air\nbags to inflate. If your car sustains ANYfront-end or side damage, have the air bag\nsystem inspected by an authorized\nSUZUKI dealer to ensure it is in properworking order.\nYour vehicle is equipped with a diagnostic\nmodule which records information about\nthe air bag system if t he air bags deploy in\na crash. The module records information\nabout overall system status, which sensors\nactivated the deployment, and whether the\nfront seat belts were in use.Servicing the Air Bag System\nIf the air bags inflate, have the air bags andrelated components replaced by an autho-\nrized SUZUKI dealer as soon as possible.\nIf your vehicle ever gets in deep water and\nthe driver\u2019s floor is submerged, the air bag\ncontroller could be damaged. If this hap-pens, have the air bag system inspected\nby the SUZUKI dealer as soon as possible.\nSpecial procedures are required for servic-\ning or replacing an air bag. For that reason,\nonly an authorized SUZUKI dealer shouldbe allowed to service or replace your air\nbags. Please remind anyone who services\nyour SUZUKI that it has air bags.\nService on or around air bag components\nor wiring must be performed only by anauthorized SUZUKI dealer. Improper ser-\nvice could result in unintended air bag\ndeployment or could render the air bagsinoperative.

If\npower assistance is lost due to a stalledengine or other failures, the system is still\nfully operational on reserve power and you\ncan bring the vehicle to a complete stop bypressing the brake pedal once and holding\nit down. The reserve power is partly used\nup when you depress the brake pedal andreduces each time the pedal is pressed.\nApply smooth and even pressure to the\npedal. Do not pump the pedal.Brake Assist System\nWhen you slam the brakes on, the brakeassist system judges as an emergencystop and provides more powerful braking\nfor a driver who cannot hold down the\nbrake pedal firmly.\nNOTE:\nIf you quickly and forcefully depress thebrakes, you may hear a clicking sound in\nthe brake pedal. This is normal and indi-\ncates that the brake as sist system is acti-\nvated properly.Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS)\nABS will help you avoid skidding by elec-tronically controlling braking pressure. It\nwill also help you maintain steering control\nwhen braking on slippery surfaces or whenbraking hard.\nThe ABS works automatically, so you do\nnot need any special braking technique.\nJust push the brake pedal down without\npumping. The ABS will operate whenever itsenses that the wheels are locking up.\nYou may feel the brake pedal pulsate while\nthe ABS is operating.\nNOTE:\nThe ABS will not work if vehicle speed is\nunder about 6 km/h (4 mph).WARNING\nIf water gets into the brake drums,\nbrake performance may become poorand unpredictable. After driving\nthrough water or washing the under-\nside of the vehicle, test the brakeswhile driving at a sl ow speed to see if\nthey have maintained their normaleffectiveness. If the brakes are lesseffective than normal, dry them by\nrepeatedly applying the brakes while\ndriving slowly until the brakes haveregained their normal effectiveness.WARNING\nEven without reserve power in thebrake system, you can still stop thevehicle by pressing the brake pedal\nharder than normally required. How-\never, the stopping distance may belonger.\n3-30OPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\n79K21-03E65D451\n(1) ABS warning light Type 1\n(2) ABS warning light Type 2\n(3) Brake system warning lightWARNING\n\u007f On some types of loose surfaces\n(such as gravel, snow-coveredroads, etc.), the stopping distance\nrequired for an ABS-equipped vehi-\ncle may be slightly greater than fora comparable vehicle with a con-\nventional brake system. With a\nconventional brake system, skid-ding tires are able to \u201cplow\u201d the\ngravel or snow layer, shortening\nthe stopping distance. ABS mini-mizes this resistance effect. Allow\nfor extra stoppi ng distance when\ndriving on loose surfaces.\n\u007f On regular paved roads, some driv-\ners may be able to obtain slightly\nshorter stopping distances withconventional brake systems than\nwith ABS.\n\u007f In both of the above conditions,\nABS will still offer the advantage ofhelping you maintain directional\ncontrol. However, remember thatABS will not compensate for bad\nroad or weather conditions or poor\ndriver judgment. Use good judg-ment and do not drive faster than\nconditions will safely allow.WARNING\nIf the ABS warning light ((1) or (2)) on\nthe instrument panel comes on andstays on while driving, there may be a\nproblem with the ABS system.\nIf this happens:1) Pull off the road and stop care-\nfully.\n2) Turn the ignition switch to \u201cLOCK\u201d\nand then start the engine again.\n(Continued)(1) (2)\n(3)orWARNING\n(Continued)\nIf the warning light comes on brieflythen turns off, th e system is normal.\nIf the warning light still stays on,have the system inspected by yourSUZUKI dealer imme diately. If the\nABS system becomes inoperative,the brake system will function as anordinary brake system that has no\nABS.\nWARNING\nIf the ABS warning light ((1) or (2))\nand the Brake system warning light\n(3) on the instrument panel simulta-\nneously stay on or come on when\ndriving, both anti-lock function andrear brake force control function\n(Proportioning valv e function) of the\nABS system may have failed. This\ncould cause the rear wheels to skid\nor the vehicle to spin during braking\non a slippery road or hard braking ona dry paved road. If both warning\nlights come on, drive carefully, avoid-\ning hard braking as much as possi-ble, and ask your SUZUKI dealer to\ninspect the ABS system immediately.\n3-31OPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\n79K21-03EHow the ABS Works\nA computer continuously monitors wheel\nspeed. The computer compares the\nchanges in wheel speed when braking. If\nthe wheels slow suddenly, indicating askidding situation, the computer will\nchange braking pressure several times\neach second to prevent the wheels fromlocking. When you start your vehicle or\nwhen you accelerate after a hard stop, you\nmay hear a momentary motor or clickingsound as the system resets or checks\nitself.Electronic Stability Program \n(ESP\u00ae)\nESP\u00ae is a registered trademark of Daimler\nAG.\nThe Electronic Stability Program (ESP\u00ae)\nhelps to control the vehicle during corner-\ning if front wheels or rear wheels skid. Italso assists you in maintaining traction\nwhile accelerating on loose or slippery\nroad surfaces. It does this by regulating theengine\u2019s output, and by selectively apply-\ning the brakes. In addition, ESP\n\u00ae helps to\navoid skidding by controlling braking pres-\nsure.The ESP\u00ae has the following three systems:\nStability Control System\nThe vehicle stability control system helps\nprovide integrated co ntrol of systems such\nas anti-lock brakes, traction control, engine\ncontrol, etc. This  system automatically\ncontrols the brakes and engine to help pre-\nvent the vehicle from skidding when cor-\nnering on a slippery road surface or when\nturning the steering wheel abruptly.\nTraction Control System\nThe traction control system automatically\nhelps prevent the spinning of wheels whenthe vehicle is started or accelerated onslippery road surfaces. The system oper-\nates only if it senses that some of the\nwheels are spinning or beginning to losetraction. When this happens, the system\noperates the front or rear brakes and\nreduces engine power to limit wheel spin.\nNOTE:\nYou may hear a clicking sound in theengine compartment for a few seconds\nwhen you start the engine or just after the\nvehicle begins to move. This means thatthe above systems are in the self-check\nmode. This sound does not indicate a mal-\nfunction.WARNING\nThe ABS may not work properly if\ntires or wheels other than those\nspecified in the owner\u2019s manual areused. This is because the ABS works\nby comparing changes in wheel\nspeed. When repl acing tires or\nwheels, use only the size and type\nspecified in this owner\u2019s manual.WARNING\nThe ESP\u00ae cannot enhance the vehi-\ncle\u2019s driving stability in all situationsand does not control your vehicle\u2019s\nentire braking system. The ESP\n\u00ae can-\nnot prevent accidents, including\nthose resulting from excessive speed\nin turns, or hydroplaning. Only a safeand attentive driver can prevent acci-\ndents. The capabilities of an ESP\n\u00ae-\nequipped vehic le must never be used\nas a substitute for careful driving.\n3-32OPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\n79K21-03EAnti-Lock Braking System (ABS)\nABS will help you avoid skidding by elec-\ntronically controlling braking pressure. It\nwill also help you maintain steering control\nwhen braking on slippery surfaces or whenbraking hard. The ABS works automati-\ncally, so you do not have to use any specialbraking technique. Just push the brakepedal down without pumping. The ABS will\noperate whenever it senses that wheelsare locking up. You may feel the brakepedal pulsate while the ABS is operating.\n(For more information on ABS, see \u201cBrak-ing\u201d in the \u201cOPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\u201dsection.)\nNOTE:\nIf the ABS system is activated, you may\nhear a clunking noise and/or feel pulsating\nin the brake pedal.

A Tire Pressure MonitoringSystem (TPMS) sensor containing a\nunique identification code is mounted on\neach wheel. The TPMS sensors transmit\ntire pressure signals to a central receiver\nwhich relays the information to a tire pres-\nsure monitoring syst em controller. When\nthe inflation pressure of one or more tires\nindicates significant under-inflation, the low\ntire pressure warning light shown belowcomes on.\nNOTE:\nThe TPMS controller is not programmed to\nrecognize the ID code of the TPMS sensor\nin your spare tire. The tire pressure moni-toring system will only work with the spare\ntire if you bring your vehicle to an autho-\nrized SUZUKI dealer to register the IDcode of the spare tire sensor. Refer to\n\u201cReplacing Tires and/or Wheels\u201d in this\nsection.Low Tire Pressure Warning Light\n52D305\nWARNING\nEach tire, includin g the spare (if pro-\nvided), should be checked monthlywhen cold and inflated to the inflation\npressure recommended by the vehi-\ncle manufacturer on the vehicle plac-\nard or tire inflation pressure label. (Ifyour vehicle has tires of a different\nsize than the size  indicated on the\nvehicle placard or tire inflation pres-\nsure label, you should determine the\nproper tire inflation pressure for\nthose tires.)As an added safety feature, your\nvehicle has been equipped with a tire\npressure monitoring system (TPMS)that illuminates a low tire pressure\ntelltale when one or more of your\ntires is significantly under-inflated.\n(Continued)WARNING\n(Continued)Accordingly, when the low tire pres-sure telltale illuminates, you should\nstop and check your tires as soon as\npossible, and inflate them to theproper pressure.\nDriving on a significantly under-\ninflated tire causes the tire to over-heat and can lead to tire failure.\nUnder-inflation also reduces fuel effi-\nciency and tire tread life, and may\naffect the vehicl e\u2019s handling and\nstopping ability.Please note that the TPMS is not asubstitute for prop er tire mainte-\nnance, and it is th e driver\u2019s responsi-\nbility to mainta in correct tire\npressure, even if un der-inflation has\nnot reached the level to trigger illumi-nation of the TPMS low tire pressuretelltale.\n3-39OPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\n79K21-03EThe low tire pressure warning light can\ncome on due to normal causes such asnatural air leaks and pressure changes\ncaused by changes in temperature or\natmospheric pressure.

Check tire\ninflation pressure s monthly when\ncold and set to the recommended\ninflation pressure as specified on the\nvehicle\u2019s tire information placard andin the owner\u2019s manual. Refer to\u201cTires\u201d in the \u201cINSPECTION AND\nMAINTENANCE\u201d section.\nWARNING\nIf the low tire pre ssure warning light\ndoes not come on when the ignition\nis turned to the \u201cON\u201d position, or\ncomes on and blinks while drivingthere may be a problem with the tirepressure monitori ng system. Have\nyour vehicle inspected by an autho-rized SUZUKI dealer. Even if the lightturns off after bl inking, indicating\nthat the monitoring system hasrecovered, make sure to have anauthorized SUZUKI dealer check the\nsystem.WARNING\nThe load rating of your tires isreduced at lower inflation pressures.If your tires become even moderately\nunder-inflated, the vehicle load may\nexceed the load rating of the tires,which can lead to tire failure. The low\ntire pressure warning light will not\nalert you of this condition. The warn-ing light will only come on when one\nor more of your tires become signifi-\ncantly under-inflated. Check andadjust your tire inflation pressure at\nleast once a month. Refer to \u201cTires\u201din the \u201cINSPECTION AND MAINTE-NANCE\u201d section.WARNING\nIf the low tire pre ssure warning light\ncomes on and stays on, reduce yourspeed and avoid abru pt steering and\nbraking.

This\ncould lead to an accident, resulting in\nsevere injury or death.\n3-40OPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\n79K21-03Eon the tire information placard should\ncause the low tire pressure warning light to\nturn off. \nIf the light turns on again shortly after\nadjusting the pressure in your tires, youmay have a flat tire. If you have a flat tire,\nreplace it with the spare tire. Refer to\n\u201cJacking Instructions\u201d in the \u201cEMER-GENCY SERVICE\u201d section. Refer to\n\u201cReplacing Tires and/or Wheels\u201d for\ninstructions on how to restore normal oper-ation of the tire pressure monitoring sys-\ntem after you have had a flat tire.\nNOTE:\n\u007f When the tire inflation pressure is\nadjusted in high altitude areas, the low\ntire pressure light may not turn off even\nafter tire inflation pressure adjustment.\nIn this case, adjust the inflation pressure\nto a slightly higher pressure than is\nshown on the tire information placard.\n\u007f The low tire pressure warning light may\nturn off temporarily after coming on. Thiscould be due to surface temperature\nincreases after long distance driving ortraveling to a high temperature area.\nEven if the tire pressure warning light\nturns off after coming on, make sure tocheck the inflation pressure of all tires.\n\u007f To reduce the chance that the low tire\npressure warning light will come on dueto normal changes in temperature and\natmospheric pressure, it is important to\ncheck and adjust the tire pressureswhen the tires are cold. Tires that\nappear to be at the specified pressurewhen checked after driving, when thetires are warm, could have pressure\nbelow the specification when the tires\ncool down. Also, tires that are inflated tothe specified pressure in a warm garage\nmay have pressure below the specifica-\ntion when the vehicle is driven outside invery cold temperature. If you adjust the\ntire pressure in a garage that is warmer\nthan the outside temperature, youshould add 1 psi to the recommended\ncold tire inflation pressure for every 10\u00b0F\ndifference between garage temperatureand outside temperature.\nFor tire inflation pressure information, referto \u201cTire Inflation Pre ssure\u201d in the \u201cINSPEC-\nTION AND MAINTENANCE\u201d section.\nTPMS Malfunction IndicatorWhen you turn off the engine, however, themalfunction indicator resets.

Specific design characteris-\ntics give them a higher center of gravity\nthan ordinary cars. An advantage of thehigher ground clearance is a better view of\nthe road allowing you to anticipate prob-\nlems. They are not designed for corneringat the same speed as conventional pas-\nsenger cars any more than low-slung\nsports cars are designed to perform satis-factorily under off-road conditions. If at all\npossible, avoid sharp turns or abrupt\nmaneuvers. As with other vehicles of thistype, failure to operate this vehicle cor-\nrectly may result in loss of control or vehi-\ncle rollover.\nMultipurpose vehicles have a significantly\nhigher rollover rate than other types ofvehicles.65D218\nIn a rollover crash, an unbelted person is\nsignificantly more likely to die than a per-\nson wearing a seat belt.\nImportant Differences Between \nYour Multipurpose Vehicle and \nOrdinary Passenger Cars\nHigher Ground Clearance\nThe higher ground clearance of your vehi-\ncle enables it to clear off-road obstacles,\nsuch as rocks and tree stumps, that ordi-nary passenger cars cannot drive over. An\nunavoidable result of this higher ground\nclearance is that the vehicle also has ahigher center of gravity. Consequently,\nyour vehicle will handle differently than a\nvehicle with a lower center of gravity.WARNING\n\u007f Wear Your Seat Belts at All Times.\nEven though air bags are equippedat the front seating  positions, the\ndriver and all passengers shouldbe properly restrained at all times,using the seat belts provided. Refer\nto the \u201cSeat Belts and Child\nRestraint Systems\u201d section forinstructions on proper use of the\nseat belts.\n\u007f Never drive whil e under the influ-\nence of alcohol or other drugs.Alcohol and drugs can seriously\nimpair your ability to drive safely,greatly increasing the risk of injury\nto yourself and others. You shouldalso avoid driving when you aretired, sick, irritated or under stress.\nWARNING\nYour multipurpose vehicle has han-\ndling characteristics that differ from\nthose of a conventional passengercar. For the safety of you and your\npassengers, please r ead the follow-\ning section very carefully.EXAMPLE\nImportant Vehicle Design Features To Know: NO\n4-2DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03EShorter Wheelbase\nAlong with its higher ground clearance,\nyour vehicle has a shorter wheelbase andshorter front and rear overhangs than\nmany passenger cars. These features\ncombine to allow you to drive your vehicleover hillcrests without hanging up on them\nor damaging the frame and chassis com-\nponents. The shorter wheelbase alsomakes the steering of your vehicle more\nresponsive than that of vehicles with longer\nwheelbases.\nNarrower Body Width and Track\nYour vehicle is narrower than the averagepassenger car so that  it can pass through\ntight spaces.\nWithout the essential characteristics\ndescribed above: higher ground clearance,\nshorter wheelbase and narrower bodywidth and track \u2013 your vehicle could not\nprovide you with excellent off road driving\nperformance. However, it is also true thaton-pavement driving, handling and steer-\ning will be different from what drivers expe-\nrience with a conventional passenger car.Break-In Catalytic Converter\n54G236\nThe purpose of the catalytic converter is tominimize the amount of harmful pollutantsin your vehicle\u2019s exhaust. Use of leaded\nfuel in vehicles equipped with catalytic\nconverters is prohibited by federal law,because lead deactivates the pollutant-\nreducing components of the catalyst sys-\ntem.\nThe converter is designed to last the life of\nthe vehicle under normal usage and whenunleaded fuel is used. No special mainte-\nnance is required on the converter. How-\never, it is very important to keep the engineproperly tuned. Engine misfiring, which\ncan result from an improperly tuned\nengine, may cause overheating of the cat-alyst. This may result in permanent heat\ndamage to the catalyst and other vehicle\ncomponents.CAUTION\nThe future performa nce and reliabil-\nity of the engine depends on the care\nand restraint exercised during itsearly life. It is especially important toobserve the following precautions\nduring the initial 960 km (600 miles)\nof vehicle operation.\n\u007f After starting, do not race the\nengine. Warm it up gradually.\n\u007f Avoid prolonged vehicle operation\nat a constant speed. Moving parts\nwill break in better if you vary your\nspeed.\n\u007f Start off from a stop slowly. Avoid\nfull throttle starts.\n\u007f Avoid hard stopping, especially\nduring the first 320 km (200 miles)\nof driving.\n\u007f Do not drive slowly with the trans-\nmission in a high gear.\n\u007f Drive the vehicle at moderate\nengine speeds.\n\u007f Do not tow a trailer during the first\n960 km (600 miles) of vehicle oper-\nation.EXAMPLEImportant Vehicle Design Features To Know: NO\nOn-Pavement Driving: NO\n4-3DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03E54G584SImproving Fuel Economy\nThe following instructions will help you\nimprove fuel economy.\nAvoid excessive idling\nIf you are to wait for more than a minutewhile you are parked, stop the engine and\nstart it again later. When warming up a\ncold engine, allow the engine to idle untilthe temperature gauge pointer comes up\nto the \u201cC\u201d position. In this position, the\nengine is sufficiently warm for starting off.\nAvoid \u201cjackrabbit\u201d starts\nFast starts away from lights or stop signswill consume fuel unnecessarily and\nshorten engine life. Start off slowly.\nAvoid unnecessary stops\nAvoid unnecessary deceleration and stop-\nping. Try to maintain a slow, steady speedwhenever possible. Slowing down and then\naccelerating again uses more fuel.\nKeep a steady cruising speed\nKeep as constant a speed as road and traf-\nfic conditions will permit.CAUTION\nTo minimize the possibility of catalystor other vehicle damage:\u007f Maintain the engine in the proper\noperating condition.\n\u007f In the event of an engine malfunc-\ntion, particularly one involving\nengine misfire or other apparent\nloss of performance, have the vehi-cle serviced promptly.\n\u007f Do not shut off the engine or inter-\nrupt the ignition when the transmis-\nsion is in gear and the vehicle is in\nmotion.\n\u007f Do not try to start the engine by\npushing or towing the vehicle orcoasting down a hill.\n\u007f Do not idle the engine with any\nspark plug wires disconnected orremoved, such as during diagnos-\ntic testing.\n\u007f Do not idle the vehicle for pro-\nlonged periods if idling seemsrough or there are other malfunc-tions.\n\u007f Do not allow the fuel tank to get\nnear the empty level.WARNING\nBe careful where you park and drive;the catalytic converter and otherexhaust components can get very\nhot. As with any vehicle, do not park\nor operate this ve hicle in areas where\ncombustible materials such as dry\ngrass or leaves can come in contact\nwith a hot exhaust system.\nOn-Pavement Driving: NO\nOff-Road Driving: NO\n4-4DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03EKeep the air cleaner clean\n60A183S\nIf the air cleaner is clogged with dust, there\nwill be greater intake resistance, resultingin decreased power output and increased\nfuel consumption.\nKeep weight to a minimum\nThe heavier the load, the more fuel the\nvehicle consumes. Take out any luggageor cargo when it is not necessary.\nKeep tire pressure correct\nUnderinflation of the tires can waste fuel\ndue to increased running resistance of the\ntires. Keep your tires inflated to the correctpressure shown on the label located below\nthe driver\u2019s side door latch striker.On-Pavement Driving\nGovernment data show that most rollover\naccidents for multi-purpose vehicles arecaused when a driver loses control of the\nvehicle and leaves the paved portion of the\nroadway striking a ditch, curb or other off-road object that causes the vehicle to over-\nturn. The following driving practices may\nreduce the risk of rollover.\nVehicle Slides Off-Road\nYou can reduce the risk of this kind of roll-over accident by always keeping the vehi-\ncle under control. Typically, drivers lose\ncontrol of vehicles, often resulting in roll-over accidents, when the driver is impaired\nbecause of alcohol or other drugs, falls\nasleep at the wheel or is otherwise inatten-tive, or is driving too fast for the road condi-\ntions.\nRollovers On the Roadway\nIf, for any reason, your vehicle slides side-\nways or spins out of control at highwayspeeds, while on the paved portion of the\nroadway, the risk of rollover is greatly\nincreased. This condition can be createdwhen two or more wheels drop off onto the\nshoulder and you steer sharply in an\nattempt to reenter the roadway. To reducethe risk of rollover in these circumstances,\nif conditions permit, you should hold the\nsteering wheel firmly and slow downbefore pulling back into the travel lanes\nwith controlled steering movements.All Types of Rollover AccidentsAs with many kinds of automobile acci-\ndents, rollovers can be greatly reduced bydoing what all prudent drivers should do,\ni.e., don\u2019t drink and drive, don\u2019t drive when\ntired and don\u2019t do anything behind thewheel that could cause a loss of attention\nto the driving task.\nAdditional guidelines are set out below for\nyour on-road driving.\nKnow Your Vehicle\nTake time to familiarize yourself with the\nunique handling characteristics of yourvehicle by first driving around in an area\naway from traffic. Practice turning the vehi-\ncle at a variety of speeds and in differentdirections. Get a feel for the greater steer-\ning response that your vehicle has over a\nconventional car.\nWear Your Seat Belts at All Times\nThe driver and all passengers should beproperly restrained at all times, using the\nseat belts provided. Refer to the \u201cSeat\nBelts and Child Restraint Systems\u201d sectionfor instructions on pr oper use of the seat\nbelts.\nEXAMPLEOff-Road Driving: NO\n4-5DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03EDon\u2019t Make Sharp Turns\nAs mentioned before, small multipurpose\nvehicles have specific design characteris-tics that allow them to perform in a wide\nvariety of applications. These characteris-\ntics also change the cornering behaviorrelative to conventional passenger cars.\nRemember, small multipurpose vehicles\nhave more responsive steering and ahigher center of gravity than conventional\npassenger cars. If at all possible, avoid\nmaking sharp turns in your vehicle.\nSlow Down on Curves\nLearn to approach curves cautiously andat a conservative speed. Do not attempt to\ntake curves at the same speeds that you\nwould in a vehicle with a lower center ofgravity. Just as you would not drive a\nsports car on a trail, you should not\nattempt to drive your vehicle around curveslike a sports car.\nSlow Down and Use Caution on Slip-\npery Roads\nUnder wet road conditions you should\ndrive at a lower speed than on dry roadsdue to possible slippage of tires during\nbraking. When driving on icy, snowcovered\nor muddy roads, reduce your speed andavoid sudden acceleration, abrupt braking\nor sharp steering movements. Use 4-wheel\ndrive high range (4H) (if equipped) for bet-ter traction.NOTE:Avoid operating your vehicle in \u201c4H LOCK\u201d\nor \u201c4L LOCK\u201d on wet pavement as much\nas possible. Operating your vehicle in \u201c4HLOCK\u201d or \u201c4L LOCK\u201d on wet pavement\nmay cause severe damage to the drive\ntrain.\nNOTE:\nOperating your vehicle in \u201c4H\u201d on dry andtight corner may cause some vibration on\nyour vehicle. This is not caused by the\nvehicle malfunction, but caused by workingof the limited slip differential gear in the\ncenter differential.CAUTION\nDo not operate your vehicle in \u201c4H\nLOCK\u201d or \u201c4L LOCK\u201d on dry, hardsurfaces. Operating your vehicle in\n\u201c4H LOCK\u201d or \u201c4L LOCK\u201d on dry,\nhard surfaces puts severe stress tothe drive train, especi ally during tight\ncornering, and can damage it. Also,you may have some difficulty steer-ing.CAUTION\nUnevenly worn tires can cause prob-lems in the operat ion of the transfer\nswitch. Be sure to rotate the tires\naccording to the maintenance sched-\nule. Refer to \u201cTires\u201d and \u201cMainte-nance Schedule\u201d in the\n\u201cINSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE\u201d\nsection for proper tire rotation proce-dures.Off-Road Driving: NO\n4-6DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03EOff-Road Driving\nYour vehicle has specific design character-\nistics for off-road driving. When you leavethe pavement, you will encounter driving\nsurfaces of all kinds which may change\ncontinually as you drive. In most cases, off-road driving requires the use of 4-wheel\ndrive. If your vehicle is a 2-wheel drive\nvehicle, you should limit your off-road driv-ing only to hard, flat, nonslippery surfaces.\n2-wheel drive vehicles have far less trac-\ntion on off-road surfaces than 4-wheeldrive vehicles. It is important when driving\noff-road to follow the guidelines below.\nUse Caution on Steep Inclines\nAlways inspect hills be fore you attempt to\ndrive up them. Know what is on the other\nside and how you will get back down. If you\nhave any doubt that it is safe, do not\nattempt to drive over a hill. Never driveyour vehicle up an extremely steep incline.\nComing down a steep hill can be trickier\nthan getting up one. Keep the vehicle\nheading straight down the hill and use low\ngear. Do not lock the brakes. If the vehiclebegins to slide, accelerate slightly to regain\nsteering control.Do Not Turn on or Drive Across the Sideof Hills\nTurning on or driving across the side of ahill can be extremely hazardous. Most of\nthe vehicle\u2019s weight will be transferred to\nthe downhill tires, which could result in thevehicle rolling sideways. Whenever possi-\nble, avoid this potential hazard. Also, if you\nhave to exit your vehicle on a side-hill,always get out on the uphill side.\nWear Your Seat Belts at All Times\nYou and your passengers should use the\nseat belts at all times when driving off-\nroad. For proper seat belt use, refer to the\u201cSeat Belts and Child Restraint Systems\u201d\nsection in this manual.\nAvoid Sudden Reactions in Mud, Ice or\nSnow\nBe careful when off-road conditions areslick. Reduce your speed and avoid sud-\nden movements of the vehicle. If your vehi-\ncle is a 2-wheel drive vehicle, do not drivein deep snow or mud. If your vehicle is a 4-\nwheel drive vehicle, be aware that driving\nin deep snow or mud can cause a loss oftraction and an increase in the resistance\nto the vehicle\u2019s forward motion. Use 4WD\nlow gear (4L) and maintain a steady butmoderate speed with a light touch on the\nsteering wheel and brakes.Do not drive in the field covered withgrown grass\nIf you drive in the field covered with grass,it may cause unexpected accident or vehi-\ncle damage by getting caught in grown\ngrass.\nIf Your Vehicle Gets Stuck\nIf your vehicle gets stuck in snow, mud orsand, follow the directions below:\n1) (For vehicles equipped with transfer\nswitch) Turn the transfer switch to \u201c4H\nLOCK\u201d or \u201c4L LOCK\u201d.\n2) Shift the transmission back and forth\nbetween a forward range (or first gearfor manual transmission) and reverse.\nThis will create a rocking motion which\nmay give you enough momentum tofree the vehicle. Press gently on the\naccelerator to keep wheel spin to a min-\nimum. Remove your foot from theaccelerator while shifting. \nDo not race the engine. Excessive\nwheel spin will cause the tires to digdeeper, making it more difficult to free\nthe vehicle.\n3) If your vehicle remains stuck after a few\nminutes of rocking, get another vehicleto pull you out.\n4-7DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03ETire Chains\nTire chains should only be used if they are\nneeded to increase traction or are required\nby law. Make sure that the chains you use\nare small-link chains or cable-type chainsand are the correct size for your vehicle\u2019s\ntires. Also make sure that there is enough\nclearance between the fenders and thechains as installed on the tires.\nInstall the chains on the rear tires tightly,\naccording to the chain manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. Retight en the chains after\ndriving about 1.0 km (1/2 mile) if neces-\nsary. With the chains installed, drive slowly.Do not drive throug h deep or rushing\nwaterDriving in deep or rushing water can behazardous. You could lose control of the\nvehicle and the occupants could drown.\nAlso, your vehicle could be seriously dam-aged. To avoid these risks, observe the fol-\nlowing instructions and precautions.\n\u007f Do not drive through deep or rushing\nwater. Deep or rushing water, such as\nfast-moving streams or floodwaters,could carry your vehicle away from your\nintended path. The water is too deep if it\ncovers your wheel hubs, axles orexhaust tailpipe. Know the depth of the\nwater before you attempt to drive\nthrough it.\n\u007f If water blocks the tailpipe, the engine\nmay not start or run. If the water is deepenough to get drawn into the engineintake system, the engine will be badly\ndamaged.\n\u007f Submerged brakes will have poor brak-\ning performance. Drive slowly and care-fully. Driving slowly will also help avoid\nwater splashing onto the ignition system,\nwhich could cause the engine to stall.\n\u007f Even when driving through shallow or\nstill waters, drive carefully since thewater may be hiding ground hazards\nsuch as holes, ditches or bumps.WARNING\n\u007f Do not allow anyone to stand near\nthe vehicle when you are rocking it,\nand do not spin the wheels faster\nthan an indicated 40 km/h (25 mph)\non the speedometer. Personalinjury and/or vehicle damage may\nresult from spinning the wheels too\nfast.\n\u007f Be sure to turn the transfer switch\nfrom \u201c4H\u201d to \u201c4H LOCK\u201d or \u201c4LLOCK\u201d when the tires slip in \u201c4H\u201d. The continuing tires slip in \u201c4H\u201d\ncan cause the limite d slip differen-\ntial gear damage in the center dif-\nferential.\nCAUTION\nRelease the accelerator pedal when\noperating the gearshift lever. Operat-\ning the lever with the engine racing\ncan damage the gears.\nCAUTION\nDo not continue rocking the vehicle\nfor more than a few minutes. Pro-\nlonged rocking can cause engine\noverheating, transmission or trans-\nfer case damage or tire damage.CAUTION\nIf you hear the chains hitting against\nthe vehicle body while driving, stop\nand tighten them.\n4-8DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03EWARNING\nIn addition to following the driving\ntips in this section, it is important toobserve the following precautions for\non-road and off-road driving.\n\u007f Driver and passen gers should wear\nseat belts at all times.\n\u007f Do not let anyone else drive your\nvehicle unless they are also awareof the vehicle characteristics and\nhandling differences described in\nthis section.\n\u007f Avoid loaning your vehicle to any-\none unless you accompany them.\n\u007f Make sure your tires are in good\ncondition and always maintain the\nspecified tire pressure. Refer to\n\u201cTires\u201d in the \u201cINSPECTION ANDMAINTENANCE\u201d section for\ndetails.\n\u007f Do not use tires other than those\nspecified by SUZUKI. Never use dif-ferent sizes or types of tires on the\nfront and rear wheels. For informa-tion regarding the specified tires,\nrefer to the Tire Inflation Pressure\nLabel located on the driver\u2019s sidedoor pillar or the \u201cSPECIFICA-\nTIONS\u201d section.\n(Continued)WARNING\n(Continued)\u007f Never use oversized tires or special\nshocks and springs to raise (jack\nup) your vehicle. This will raise the\ncenter of gravity of the vehicle andchange its handling characteris-\ntics. Oversized tires may also rub\nagainst the fender over bumps,causing vehicle damage or tire fail-\nure.\n\u007f After driving through water, mud or\nsandy ground, test the brakes whiledriving at a slow speed to see if\nthey have mainta ined their normal\neffectiveness. If the brakes are less\neffective than normal, dry them by\nrepeatedly appl ying the brakes\nwhile driving slowly until the\nbrakes have regained their normal\neffectiveness.\n\u007f Do not use \u201c4H LOCK\u201d or \u201c4L\nLOCK\u201d drive for normal driving.\n\u007f After extended operation in mud,\nsand or water, have the brakes\ninspected by your authorized\nSUZUKI dealer as  soon as possi-\nble.\n4-9DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03EMEMO\nOTHER CONTROLS AND EQUIPMENT\n5\n79K21-03E60G407OTHER CONTROLS AND EQUIPMENT\nAutomatic Heating and Ai r Conditioning System \n(Climate Control) .................................................................5-1\nRadio Antenna .....................................................................5-8Audio Systems (Type A) .....................................................5-8Audio Systems (Type B) .....................................................5-36Fuel Filler Cap .....................................................................5-62Engine Hood ........................................................................5-63Sun Visor .............................................................................5-64Interior Light Switch ...........................................................5-64Luggage Compartment Light .............................................5-65Spot Light ............................................................................5-66Accessory Socket (if eq uipped) ........ .................................5-66\nCigarette Lighter and Ashtray (if equipped) .....................5-67Sunroof (if equipped) ..........................................................5-68Assist Grips (if equipped) ..................................................5-70Coat Hooks (if equipped) ....................................................5-70Glove Box ............................................................................5-71Overhead Console Box (if equipped) ................................5-71Cup Holder and Storage Bin (if equipped) ........................5-72Front Seat Back Pocket (if equipped) ...............................5-73Shopping Hook (if equipped) .............................................5-73Armrest ................................................................................5-73Floor Mats (if equipped) .....................................................5-74Luggage Compartment Cover ............................................5-74Underfloor Bins (if equipped) ............................................5-77Luggage Restraint Loops (if equipped) ............................5-78Roof Rails or Roof Rack Anchor s (if equipped) ...............5-78\nHomeLink\u00ae (if equipped) ....................................................5-80Frame Hooks .......................................................................5-83\n5-1OTHER CONTROLS AND EQUIPMENT\n79K21-03EAutomatic Heating and Ai r Conditioning System \n(Climate Control)\nAir Outlet\n66J2501\n1 2\n2\n33\n55\n554EXAMPLE1.

If you intend to tow a trailer, it is\nessential to select a trailer and trailer tow-ing equipment which are compatible. A\nreputable trailer dealer can help you.\nFor Automatic transmission vehicles, shift\ninto \u201c3\u201d (Low 2) or \u201cL\u201d (Low 1) (if necessary)\nand frequently monitor the coolant temper-\nature gauge when towing up a steep hill. Ifthe gauge indicates overheating, park the\nvehicle in a safe place and let the enginecool down. Refer to \u201cIf the Engine Over-heats\u201d section for details on how to deal\nwith overheating.\nHitches\nUse only a trailer hitch bracket that isdesigned to bolt to the frame of your vehi-\ncle, and a hitch that is designed to bolt to\nthis bracket. We reco mmend that you use\na genuine SUZUKI trailer hitch bracket and\ntrailer hitch (available as options), or equiv-\nalent.\nSafety Chains\nAlways attach safety chains between yourvehicle and trailer. Cross safety chainsunder the tongue of the trailer so that the\ntongue will not drop to the road if the trailer\nbecomes separated from the hitch. Followthe manufacturer\u2019s recommendation for\nattaching safety chains. Always leave just\nenough slack to permit full turning. Neverallow safety chains to drag on the road.Trailer Lights\nMake sure your trailer is equipped withlights which meet federal, state and local\nrequirements.

To reduce the chancethat the low tire pressure warning lightwill come on due to normal changes intemperature and atmospheric pres-sure, it is important to check andadjust the tire pressures when the tiresare cold. Tires that appear to be at thespecified pressure when checked afterdriving, when the tires are warm, couldhave pressure below the specificationwhen the tires cool down. Also, tiresthat are inflated to the specified pres-sure in a warm garage may have pres-sure below the specification when thevehicle is driven outside in very coldtemperature. If you adjust the tirepressure in a garage that is warmerthan the outside temperature, youshould add 1 psi to the recommendedcold tire inflation pressure for every10\u00b0F difference between garage tem-perature and outside temperature.\nMeasuring air pressure\nUse the following steps to achieveproper tire inflation:1) Identify the recommended tire pres-\nsure on the vehicle\u2019s Tire and Load-ing Information Label or in theowner\u2019s manual.\n2) Remove the valve cap from the tire\nvalve stem.\n3) Using a reliable pressure gauge,\nmeasure the tire inflation pressureby pressing the tire gauge firmlyonto the valve to get a pressuremeasurement.

Thefollowing information will help youunderstand the grading system, whichapplies to vehicles sold in the U.S.Consult your SUZUKI dealer or tireretailer for help in choosing the correctreplacement tires for your vehicle.\nQuality grades can be found where\napplicable on the tire sidewall betweentread shoulder and maximum sectionwidth. For example:\nTreadwear 200 Traction AA Tempera-\nture A\nDOT Quality Grades\nTreadwear\nTraction AA A B C\nTemperature A B C\nAll Passenger Car Tires Must Conform\nTo Federal Safety Requirements inAddition To These Grades\nTreadwear\nThe treadwear grade is a comparativerating based on the wear rate of thetire when tested under controlled con-ditions on a specified government testcourse. For example, a tire graded 150would wear one and one-half (1 1/2)times as well on the governmentcourse as a tire graded 100. The rela-tive performance of tires dependsupon the actual conditions of their use,however and may depart significantlyfrom the norm due to variations in driv-ing habits, service practices and differ-ences in road characteristics andclimate.\nTraction \u2013 AA, A, B, C\nThe traction grades, from highest tolowest, are AA, A, B and C. Thosegrades represent the tire\u2019s ability tostop on wet pavement as measuredunder controlled conditions on speci-fied government test surfaces ofasphalt and concrete. A tire marked Cmay have poor traction performance.Temperature \u2013 A, B, CThe temperature grades are A (thehighest), B and C, representing thetire\u2019s resistance to the generation ofheat and its ability to dissipate heat\nwhen tested under controlled condi-tions on a specified indoor laboratorytest wheel. Sustained high tempera-ture can cause the material of the tireto degenerate and reduce tire life, andexcessive temperature can lead tosudden tire failure. The grade C corre-sponds to a level of performancewhich all passenger car tires mustmeet under the Federal Motor VehicleSafety Standard No. 109. Grades Band A represent higher levels of per-formance on the laboratory test wheelthan the minimum required by law.\nWARNING\nThe traction grade assigned tothis tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, anddoes not include acceleration,cornering, hydroplaning or peaktraction characteristics.WARNING\nThe temperature grade for thistire is established for a tire that isproperly inflated and not over-loaded. Excessive speed, under-inflation or excessive loading,either separately or in combina-tion, can cause heat buildup andpossible tire failure.Tires: 6\n7-31INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE\n79K21-03ETire Rotation\n4-tire rotation\n65D459\nTo avoid uneven wear of your tires and\nto prolong their life, rotate the tires asillustrated. Tires sh ould be rotated as\nrecommended in the periodic mainte-nance schedule. After rotation, adjustfront and rear tire pressures to thespecification listed on your vehicle\u2019sTire and Loading Information Label.WARNING\nRust or dirt on a wheel, or on theparts to which it is fastened, canmake wheel nuts become looseafter a time.

To measure the weight andload, try making your vehicle to a high-way weighing station, shipping com-pany or inspection station for trucks,etc. Compare these weights to theGVWR and GAWR (front and rear)listed on the Safety Certification Label.If the gross vehicle weight or the loadon either axle exceeds these ratings,you must remove enough weight tobring the load down to the ratedcapacity.\nSteps for Determining Correct LoadLimit1) Locate the statement \u201cThe com-\nbined weight of occupants andcargo should never exceed XXX kgor XXX lbs\u201d on your vehicle\u2019s plac-ard.\n2) Determine the combined weight of\nthe driver and pa ssengers that will\nbe riding in your vehicle.\n3) Subtract the combined weight of\nthe driver and passengers fromXXX kg or XXX lbs.\n4) The resulting figure equals the\navailable amount of cargo and lug-gage load capacity. For example, ifthe \u201cXXX\u201d amount equals 1400 lbsand there will be five 150 lb passen-\nWARNING\nNever overload your vehicle.Overloading your vehicle cancause damage to your tires andlead to poor steering and brakingwhich can result in an accident.The gross vehicle weight (sum ofthe weights of the loaded vehicle,driver and passengers) mustnever exceed the Gross VehicleWeight Rating (GVWR) listed onthe Safety Certification Label. Inaddition, never distribute a loadso that the weight on either thefront or rear axle exceeds theGross Axle Weight Rating(GAWR) listed on the Safety Certi-fication Label.WARNING\n\u007f Always distribute cargo evenly.\n\u007f To avoid personal injury or\ndamage to your vehicle, always\nsecure cargo to prevent it from\nshifting if the vehicle movessuddenly.\n\u007f Place heavier objects on the\nfloor and as far forward in thecargo area as possible. Never\npile cargo higher than the top of\nthe seatbacks.Fuses: 7\n7-35INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE\n79K21-03Egers in your vehicle, the amount of\navailable cargo and luggage loadcapacity is 650 lbs (1400 \u2013 750 (5 x150) = 650 lbs).\n5) Determine the combined weight of\nluggage and cargo being loaded onthe vehicle. That weight may notsafely exceed the available cargoand luggage load capacity calcu-lated in Step 4.\n6) If your vehicle will be towing a\ntrailer, load from your trailer will betransferred to your vehicle. Consultthis manual to determine how thisreduces the available cargo andluggage load capacity of your vehi-cle.\nVehicle Loading ExampleAs an example, suppose that the Tireand Loading Information label on yourvehicle indicates that your vehicle\u2019stotal load capacity is 950 lbs. If youwere to drive your vehicle with onepassenger, and the total combinedweight of you and your passenger was350 lbs, then the cargo and luggagecapacity of your vehicle would be 600lbs (950 \u2013 350 = 600 lbs).If you later added 2 more passengers,having a combined weight of 325 lbs,the cargo and luggage capacity ofyour vehicle would be reduced from600 lbs to 275 lbs (600 \u2013 325 = 275lbs). As you can see, as the numberand combined weight of vehicle occu-pants increase, the vehicle\u2019s cargoand luggage capacity decreases.Suppose again, that you were to takea trip in your vehicle with the samethree passengers described above,and you decided to tow a trailer havinga trailer tongue weight of 75 lbs. Thecargo and luggage capacity would bereduced again, to 200 lbs (275 \u2013 75 =200 lbs).\nDetermining Compatibility of Tire\nand Vehicle Load LimitsThe tires on your vehicle, when theyare inflated to the recommended tireinflation pressure, have a load-carry-ing capacity that is greater than theload that will be on the tires when thevehicle is at its GVWR or GAWR limit.Never use replacement tires that havea load-carrying capacity less than theoriginal tires on your vehicle. Tire load-carrying capacity information ismolded into the tire sidewall typicallyshown as \u201cMax. Load\u201d. Use of replace-ment tires with a lower load-carryingcapacity than the original tires, or fail-ure to keep the tires inflated to recom-mended tire pressure, may reduce theGVWR or GAWR limit of your vehicle.NOTE:Use of replacement tires with a higherload-carrying capacity than the origi-nal tires, or using a tire inflation pres-sure higher than the recommendedtire inflation pre ssure, will not increase\nthe GVWR or GAWR limit of your vehi-cle.\nFuses: 7\nHeadlight Aiming: Bulb Replacement: 7\n7-36INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE\n79K21-03EBattery\n60A269\nYour vehicle is equipped with a battery that\nrequires infrequent maintenance.

Please read and follow these instructions\ncarefully.\nImportant Information About Corro-\nsion\nCommon causes of corrosion\n1) Accumulation of road salt, dirt, moisture\nor chemicals in hard-to-reach areas ofthe vehicle underbody or frame.\n2) Chipping, scratches and any damage to\ntreated or painted metal surfacesresulting from minor accidents orimpact from stones and gravel.\nEnvironmental conditions which accel-erate corrosion\n1) Road salt, dust control chemicals, sea\nair or industrial pollution will all acceler-\nate the corrosion of metal.\n2) High humidity will increase the rate of\ncorrosion particularly when the temper-ature range is just above the freezing\npoint.\n3) Moisture in certain areas of a vehicle\nfor an extended period of time may pro-mote corrosion even though other body\nsections may be completely dry.\n4) High temperatures will cause an accel-\nerated rate of corrosion to parts of thevehicle which are not well ventilated to\npermit quick drying.\n52D151\nThis information illustrates the necessity of\nkeeping your vehicle (particularly the\nunderbody) as clean and dry as possible. It\nis equally important to repair any damageto the paint or protective coatings as soon\nas possible.\nHow to Help Prevent Corrosion\nWash your vehicle frequentlyThe best way to preserve the finish on your\nvehicle and to help avoid corrosion is tokeep it clean with frequent washing.\nWash your vehicle at least once during the\nwinter and once immediately after the win-\nter. Keep your vehicle, particularly the\nunderside, as clean and dry as possible.If you frequently drive on salted roads, your\nvehicle should be washed at least once a\nmonth during the winter. If you live near theocean, your vehicle should be washed at\nleast once a month throughout the year.\nWash your vehicle immediately after using\nit off-road. For washin g instructions, refer\nto the \u201cVehicle Cleaning\u201d section.\nRemove foreign material deposits\nForeign material such as salts, chemicals,road oil or tar, tree sap, bird droppings and\nindustrial fall-out may damage the finish of\nyour vehicle if it is left on painted surfaces.Remove these types of deposits as quickly\nas possible. If these deposits are difficult to\nwash off, an additional cleaner may berequired. Be sure that any cleaner you use\nis not harmful to painted surfaces and is\nspecifically intended for your purposes.Follow the manufacturer\u2019s directions when\nusing these special cleaners.\nWARNING\nForeign material can lodge betweenthe fuel tank of your vehicle and the\nskid plate which covers it. You shouldperiodically clean out any foreign\nmaterial which has accumulated in\nthis area, since it could create a firehazard. Corrosion Prevention: 5\n9-2APPEARANCE CARE\n79K21-03ERepair finish damage\nCarefully examine your vehicle for damage\nto the painted surfaces, especially if it isused off-road. Should you find any chips or\nscratches in the paint, touch them up\nimmediately to prevent corrosion fromstarting. If the chips or scratches have\ngone through to the bare metal, have a\nqualified body shop make the repair.\nKeep passenger and cargo compart-\nments cleanMoisture, dirt or mud can accumulate\nunder the floor mats and may cause corro-\nsion. Occasionally, check under thesemats to ensure that this area is clean and\ndry. More frequent checks are necessary if\nthe vehicle is used off road or in wetweather.\nCertain cargo such as chemicals, fertiliz-\ners, cleaners, salts, etc. are extremely cor-\nrosive by nature. These products should\nbe transported in sealed containers. If aspill or leak does occur, clean and dry the\narea immediately.\nUse mud and gravel shields\nThe use of mud and gravel shields will help\nprotect your vehicle, especially if you fre-quently drive on gravel or salted roads.\nFull-size shields, which extend as close to\nthe road as is practical, are the best. Thefittings for such shields should also be cor-\nrosion resistant. Please check with yourauthorized SUZUKI dealer for informationon these shields.\nStore your vehicle in a dry, well-venti-\nlated area\nDo not park your vehicle in a damp, poorlyventilated area. If you often wash your\nvehicle in the garage or if you frequently\ndrive it in when wet, your garage may bedamp. The high humidity in the garage\nmay cause or accelerate corrosion. A wet\nvehicle may corrode even in a heatedgarage if the ventilation is poor.Cover your vehicle\n50G203\nIf you cannot regularly park your vehicle ina garage, we recommend you use a vehi-cle cover. Years of exposure to midday sun\ncan cause the colors in paint, plastic parts\nand fabrics to fade. Covering your vehiclewith a high-quality, \u201cbreathable\u201d vehicle\ncover can help protect the finish from the\nharmful UV rays in sunlight, and canreduce the amount of dust and air pollution\nreaching the surface. Your SUZUKI dealer\ncan help you select the right cover for yourvehicle.WARNING\nDo not apply additional undercoatingor rust preventive coating on or\naround exhaust system components\nsuch as the catalytic converter,exhaust pipes, etc. A fire could be\nstarted if the undercoating substance\nbecomes overheated.\nCorrosion Prevention: 5\n9-3APPEARANCE CARE\n79K21-03EVehicle Cleaning\n76G044S\nCleaning Interior\nVinyl upholstery\nPrepare a solution of soap or mild deter-\ngent mixed with warm water.

In some areas,\nthe only fuels that are available are oxy-\ngenated fuels.\nOxygenated fuels whic h meet the mini-\nmum octane requirement and the require-\nments described below may be used in\nyour vehicle without jeopardizing the New\nVehicle Limited Warranty.\nNOTE:\nOxygenated fuels are fuels which containoxygen-carrying additives such as MTBE\nor alcohol.Gasoline Containing MTBE\nUnleaded gasoline containing MTBE\n(methyl tertiary butyl ether) may be used in\nyour vehicle if the MTBE content is not\ngreater than 15%. This oxygenated fueldoes not contain alcohol.\nGasoline/Ethanol blends\nBlends of unleaded gasoline and ethanol\n(grain alcohol), also known as gasohol,\nmay be used in your vehicle if the ethanolcontent is not greater than 10%.\nGasoline/Methanol blends\nFuels containing 5% or less methanol\n(wood alcohol) may be suitable for use in\nyour vehicle if they contain cosolvents andcorrosion inhibitors. Do NOT USE fuels\ncontaining more than 5% methanol under\nany circumstances. Fuel system damageor vehicle performance problems resulting\nfrom the use of such fuels are not the\nresponsibility of SUZUKI and may not becovered under the New Vehicle Limited\nWarranty.Fuel Pump Labeling\nIn some states, pumps that dispense oxy-\ngenated fuels are required to be labeled for\nthe type and percentage of oxygenate and\nwhether important additives are present.Such labels may provide enough informa-\ntion for you to determine if a particular\nblend of fuel meets the requirements listedabove. In other areas, pumps may not be\nclearly labeled as to the content or type of\noxygenate and additives. If you are notsure that the fuel you intend to use meets\nthese requirements, check with the service\nstation operator or the fuel supplier.\nNOTE:\nTo help clean the air, SUZUKI recom-mends you use the oxygenated fuels.\nHowever, if you are not satisfied with the\ndriveability or fuel economy of your vehiclewhen you are using an oxygenated fuel,\nswitch back to the regular unleaded gaso-\nline.\nCAUTION\nBe careful not to sp ill fuel containing\nalcohol while refuel ing. If fuel is\nspilled on the vehicle body, wipe it up\nimmediately. Fuels containing alco-\nhol can cause paint damage, which is\nnot covered under the New Vehicle\nLimited Warranty.Fuel Recommendation: 1, 2\nBEFORE DRIVING\n2\n79K21-03E60G404BEFORE DRIVING\nKeys ......................................................................................2-1\nDoor Locks ..........................................................................2-1Keyless Start System Remote  Controller/Keyless Entry \nSystem Transmitter .............................................................2-4Theft Deterrent Light ...........................................................2-15Windows ..............................................................................2-15\nMirrors ..................................................................................2-17\nFront Seats ..........................................................................2-18Rear Seats ............................................................................2-22\nSeat Belts and Child Restraint Systems ...........................2-26\nSupplemental Restraint System (air bags) .......................2-43Instrument Cluster ..............................................................2-54\nWarning and Indicator Lights ............................................2-55\nSpeedometer .......................................................................2-65Tachometer ..........................................................................2-65\nFuel Gauge ...........................................................................2-65\nTemperature Gauge ............................................................2-66Brightness Control ..............................................................2-66\nInformation Display (if equipped) ......................................2-67\nLighting Control Lever ........................................................2-75Front Fog Light Switch (if equipped) ................................2-78\nTurn Signal Control Lever ..................................................2-78\nHazard Warning Switch ......................................................2-79Windshield Wiper and Washer L ever .......... ......................2-79\nTilt Steering Lock Lever .....................................................2-82Horn ......................................................................................2-82Rear Window Defroster and Outside Rearview Mirrors \nDefroster (if equipped) Switch ...........................................2-82\n2-1BEFORE DRIVING\n79K21-03EKeys\n54G489\nYour vehicle comes with a pair of identical\nkeys.

Whenthe front passenger sensing system hasturned off the front passenger\u2019s front air\nbag including the seat belt pretensioner,\nthe \u201cPASS AIR BAG OFF\u201d indicator willcome on and stay on to remind you that\nthe front passenger\u2019s front air bag is off.\nThe front passenger sensing system uses\nfront seat pressure measurements and\npressure locations to determine whether toactivate or deactivate the front passenger\u2019s\nfront air bag. The front passenger sensing\nsystem may or may not turn off the front airbag, depending on the front passenger\u2019s\nseating posture and body build. The air\nbag should be turned off in the followingsituations:\n\u007f There is no occupant in the front pas-\nsenger seat.\n\u007f The occupant of the front passenger\nseat lifts his or her weight off of the seat\nfor a period of time.\n\u007f The occupant of the front passenger\nseat is an infant or small child in a childrestraint system or a small child in abooster seat.\n\u007f A smaller person, such as a child who\nhas outgrown child restraints or a verysmall adolescent is seated in the front\npassenger seat.\nNOTE:If the front passenger seat is unoccupied,\nthe \u201cPASS AIR BAG OFF\u201d indicator will notcome on but the front passenger\u2019s front air\nbag will not deploy and the seat belt pre-\ntensioner will not operate.\nIf you have secured a child in the front pas-\nsenger seat in a forward-facing childrestraint system or booster seat and the\n\u201cPASS AIR BAG OFF\u201d indi cator light is not\non, turn the vehicle off, remove the child\nrestraint or booster seat from the vehicle\nand reinstall it following the child restraint\nor booster seat manufacturer\u2019s directions.Also refer to \u201cSeat Belts and Child\nRestraint Systems\u201d in th is section. If, after\nreinstalling the child restraint and restart-ing the vehicle, the \u201cPASS AIR BAG OFF\u201dindicator is still not li t, check to make sure\nthat the vehicle\u2019s seatback is not pressing\nthe child restraint into  the seat cushion. If\nthis happens, slightly recline the vehicle\u2019sseatback and adjust the seat cushion ifpossible. Also make sure the child restraint\nis not trapped under the vehicle head\nrestraint. If this happens, adjust the headrestraint. If the \u201cPASS AIR BAG OFF\u201d indi-\ncator is still not on, secure the child in the\nchild restraint or booster seat in a rear seatposition in the vehicle and check with your\ndealer.\n2-50BEFORE DRIVING\n79K21-03E65D607\nAccording to accident statistics, children\nare safer when properly restrained in rearseating positions than in front seating posi-\ntions. Whenever possible, SUZUKI recom-mends you install child  r e s t r a i n t s  i n  t h e\nrear seat.\nThe front passenger sensing system is\ndesigned to enable the front passenger\u2019sfront air bag when the system senses a\nproperly-seated adult in the front passen-\nger\u2019s seat. When the passenger sensingsystem has allowed the air bag to be\nenabled, the \u201cPASS AI R BAG OFF\u201d indica-\ntor will remain off to remind you that the air\nbag is active.\nIf a person of adult size is sitting in the\nfront passenger\u2019s seat and the \u201cPASS AIR\nBAG OFF\u201d indicator comes on, it could be\nbecause that person isn\u2019t sitting properly inthe seat. If this happens, unfasten the seat\nbelts, sit upright in the center of the seat\nwith the seatback nearly vertical and yourlegs outstretched, and refasten the seat\nbelt.\n52D258\nWhen seated as shown in the above illus-tration, the front passenger sensing sys-\ntem senses a properly-seated occupantand enables the air bag.\nWhen using a seat belt extender, follow the\ninstructions in the \u201cSeat Belt Extender\u201d\nsection.WARNING\nDo not install a rear-facing child\nrestraint in the front passenger\u2019sseat. If the passenger\u2019s front air bag\ninflates, a child in a rear-facing child\nrestraint could be seriously injured.The back of a rear-facing child\nrestraint would be too close to the\ninflating air bag.\nWARNING\nDo not place any heavy objects on\nthe front passenger\u2019s seat. The pres-\nsure sensors in the sensor mat couldbe damaged and the front passenger\nsensing system may not work prop-\nerly.\n2-51BEFORE DRIVING\n79K21-03EHow the System Works\nIn a frontal collision, the crash sensors will\ndetect rapid deceleration and send a signal\nto the controller. If the controller judges\nthat the deceleration represents a severefrontal crash, the cont roller will trigger the\ninflators. The controller also judges:\u007f Whether the front air bags should deploy\nat reduced power or at full power accord-\ning to crash severity.\n\u007f Whether the front passenger\u2019s front air\nbag should deploy or not based on clas-sification of the occupant of the front\npassenger\u2019s seat.\nSince your vehicle is equipped with side airbags, and side curtain air bags, crash sen-sors will detect a side collision, and if the\ncontroller judges that the side collision is\nsevere enough, it will trigger the side airbag and side curtain air bag inflators.\nYour vehicle also has rollover sensors that\nwork with the controller to predict whether\na rollover may occur and if the controller\njudges that a severe rollover is about tooccur, it triggers the side curtain air bag\ninflators on both sides of the vehicle.\nThe inflators inflate the appropriate air\nbags with nitrogen or argon gas. The\ninflated air bags provide a cushion for yourhead (front air bags and side curtain air\nbags only) and upper body. The air bag\ninflates and deflates so quickly that youmay not even realize that it has activated.WARNING\nThe front passen ger sensing system\nmay not work properly in the follow-ing situations:\n\u007f The occupant is sitting near the\ndashboard or is not sitting in the\nproper position.\n\u007f Objects placed under the seat are\npushing up on the seat cushion.\nWARNING\nIf the \u201cPASS AIR BAG OFF\u201d indicatoron the instrument  panel turns on\neven though there is no occupant oran adult occupant in the front pas-\nsenger\u2019s seat, it means that some-\nthing may be wrong with the\npassenger sensing system. Have thesystem inspected by an authorized\nSUZUKI dealer as soon as possible.WARNING\n\u007f Do not spill any liquids on the seat.\nLiquids can damage the sensors\nunder the front seat.\n\u007f Have front passenger\u2019s sensor mat\ninspected by your dealer after acollision.\n\u007f Do not replace the front seats. If\nyou replace them, the air bags andfront passenger sensing system\nmay not work properly.\n\u007f Do not use a seat cover. If you use\na seat cover, the front passengersensing system may not work prop-\nerly.\n2-52BEFORE DRIVING\n79K21-03EThe air bag will neither hinder your view\nnor make it harder to exit the vehicle.\nAir bags must inflate quickly and forcefully\nin order to reduce the chance of serious or\nfatal injuries. However, an unavoidableconsequence of the quick inflation is that\nthe air bag may irritate bare skin, such as\nthe facial area against a front air bag. Also,upon inflation, a loud noise will occur and\nsome powder and smoke will be released.\nThese conditions are not harmful and donot indicate a fire in  the car. Be aware,\nhowever, that some air bag componentsmay be hot for a while after inflation.\nA seat belt helps keep you in the proper\nposition for maximum protection when anair bag inflates. Adjust your seat as far\nback as possible while still maintaining\ncontrol of the vehicle. Sit fully back in yourseat; sit up straight; do not lean over the\nsteering wheel or dashboard. Front occu-\npants should not lean on or sleep againstthe door. Please refer to the \u201cSeat Adjust-\nment\u201d section and the \u201cSeat Belts and\nChild Restraint Systems\u201d section in the\u201cBEFORE DRIVING\u201d section for details on\nproper seat and seat belt adjustments.65D610\n54G582\nWARNING\n\u007f The driver should not lean over the\nsteering wheel. The front passen-\nger should not rest his or her body\nagainst the dashbo ard, or other-\nwise get too close to the dash-\nboard. For vehicles with side air\nbags and side curtain air bags,\noccupants should not lean on orsleep against the door. In these sit-\nuations, the out-o f-position occu-\npant would be too close to an\ninflating air bag, and may suffer\nsevere injury.\n\u007f Do not attach any objects to, or\nplace any objects o ver, the steering\nwheel or dashboard. Do not place\nany objects between the air bagand the driver or front passenger.\nThese objects may in terfere with air\nbag operation or may be propelled\nby the air bag in the event of a\ncrash. Either of these conditions\nmay cause severe injury.\n(Continued)\n2-53BEFORE DRIVING\n79K21-03ENote that even though your vehicle may be\nmoderately damaged in a collision, the col-lision may not have been severe enough to\ntrigger the front, side, or side curtain air\nbags to inflate. If your car sustains ANYfront-end or side damage, have the air bag\nsystem inspected by an authorized\nSUZUKI dealer to ensure it is in properworking order.\nYour vehicle is equipped with a diagnostic\nmodule which records information about\nthe air bag system if t he air bags deploy in\na crash. The module records information\nabout overall system status, which sensors\nactivated the deployment, and whether the\nfront seat belts were in use.Servicing the Air Bag System\nIf the air bags inflate, have the air bags andrelated components replaced by an autho-\nrized SUZUKI dealer as soon as possible.\nIf your vehicle ever gets in deep water and\nthe driver\u2019s floor is submerged, the air bag\ncontroller could be damaged. If this hap-pens, have the air bag system inspected\nby the SUZUKI dealer as soon as possible.\nSpecial procedures are required for servic-\ning or replacing an air bag. For that reason,\nonly an authorized SUZUKI dealer shouldbe allowed to service or replace your air\nbags. Please remind anyone who services\nyour SUZUKI that it has air bags.\nService on or around air bag components\nor wiring must be performed only by anauthorized SUZUKI dealer. Improper ser-\nvice could result in unintended air bag\ndeployment or could render the air bagsinoperative. Either of these two conditions\nmay result in severe injury.\nTo prevent damage or unintended inflation\nof the air bag system, be sure the battery\nis disconnected and the ignition switch has\nbeen in the \u201cLOCK\u201d position for at least 90\nseconds before performing any electrical\nservice work on your SUZUKI. Do nottouch air bag system components or wires.\nThe wires are wrapped with yellow tape or\nyellow tubing, and the couplers are yellowfor easy identification.Scrapping a car that has an undeployed air\nbag can be hazardous. Ask your dealer,\nbody repair shop or scrap yard for helpwith disposal.\nIf it is necessary to modify the advanced\nfront air bag system to accommodate a\nperson with disabilities, owners in the con-\ntinental United States can call AmericanSuzuki toll-free at 1-800-934-0934, or write\nto:\nAmerican Suzuki Motor Corporation \nAutomotive Customer Relations \n3251 East Imperial Highway Brea, CA 92821-6795\nIf you purchased your SUZUKI in Canada\nplease contact the Suzuki Canada Cus-\ntomer Relations Department by telephone\nat 1-905-889-2677 extension 2254 or inwriting at:\nSuzuki Canada Inc.\nCustomer Relations\n100 East Beaver Creek Road\nRichmond Hill, OnL4B 1J6WARNING\n(Continued)\u007f For vehicles with side air bags, do\nnot place seat covers on the front\nseats, because seat covers could\nrestrict the air bag\u2019 s inflation.

The braking distance needed, for\nexample, at 60 km/h (37 mph) will be\napproximately 4 times greater than thebraking distance needed at 30 km/h (19\nmph). Start to brake the vehicle when there\nis plenty of distance between your vehicleand the stopping point, and slow down\ngradually.\n\n3-29OPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\n79K21-03EPower-Assisted Brakes\nYour vehicle has power-assisted brakes. If\npower assistance is lost due to a stalledengine or other failures, the system is still\nfully operational on reserve power and you\ncan bring the vehicle to a complete stop bypressing the brake pedal once and holding\nit down. The reserve power is partly used\nup when you depress the brake pedal andreduces each time the pedal is pressed.\nApply smooth and even pressure to the\npedal. Do not pump the pedal.Brake Assist System\nWhen you slam the brakes on, the brakeassist system judges as an emergencystop and provides more powerful braking\nfor a driver who cannot hold down the\nbrake pedal firmly.\nNOTE:\nIf you quickly and forcefully depress thebrakes, you may hear a clicking sound in\nthe brake pedal. This is normal and indi-\ncates that the brake as sist system is acti-\nvated properly.Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS)\nABS will help you avoid skidding by elec-tronically controlling braking pressure. It\nwill also help you maintain steering control\nwhen braking on slippery surfaces or whenbraking hard.\nThe ABS works automatically, so you do\nnot need any special braking technique.\nJust push the brake pedal down without\npumping. The ABS will operate whenever itsenses that the wheels are locking up.\nYou may feel the brake pedal pulsate while\nthe ABS is operating.\nNOTE:\nThe ABS will not work if vehicle speed is\nunder about 6 km/h (4 mph).WARNING\nIf water gets into the brake drums,\nbrake performance may become poorand unpredictable. After driving\nthrough water or washing the under-\nside of the vehicle, test the brakeswhile driving at a sl ow speed to see if\nthey have maintained their normaleffectiveness. If the brakes are lesseffective than normal, dry them by\nrepeatedly applying the brakes while\ndriving slowly until the brakes haveregained their normal effectiveness.WARNING\nEven without reserve power in thebrake system, you can still stop thevehicle by pressing the brake pedal\nharder than normally required. How-\never, the stopping distance may belonger.\n3-30OPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\n79K21-03E65D451\n(1) ABS warning light Type 1\n(2) ABS warning light Type 2\n(3) Brake system warning lightWARNING\n\u007f On some types of loose surfaces\n(such as gravel, snow-coveredroads, etc.), the stopping distance\nrequired for an ABS-equipped vehi-\ncle may be slightly greater than fora comparable vehicle with a con-\nventional brake system. With a\nconventional brake system, skid-ding tires are able to \u201cplow\u201d the\ngravel or snow layer, shortening\nthe stopping distance. ABS mini-mizes this resistance effect. Allow\nfor extra stoppi ng distance when\ndriving on loose surfaces.\n\u007f On regular paved roads, some driv-\ners may be able to obtain slightly\nshorter stopping distances withconventional brake systems than\nwith ABS.\n\u007f In both of the above conditions,\nABS will still offer the advantage ofhelping you maintain directional\ncontrol. However, remember thatABS will not compensate for bad\nroad or weather conditions or poor\ndriver judgment. Use good judg-ment and do not drive faster than\nconditions will safely allow.WARNING\nIf the ABS warning light ((1) or (2)) on\nthe instrument panel comes on andstays on while driving, there may be a\nproblem with the ABS system.\nIf this happens:1) Pull off the road and stop care-\nfully.\n2) Turn the ignition switch to \u201cLOCK\u201d\nand then start the engine again.\n(Continued)(1) (2)\n(3)orWARNING\n(Continued)\nIf the warning light comes on brieflythen turns off, th e system is normal.\nIf the warning light still stays on,have the system inspected by yourSUZUKI dealer imme diately. If the\nABS system becomes inoperative,the brake system will function as anordinary brake system that has no\nABS.\nWARNING\nIf the ABS warning light ((1) or (2))\nand the Brake system warning light\n(3) on the instrument panel simulta-\nneously stay on or come on when\ndriving, both anti-lock function andrear brake force control function\n(Proportioning valv e function) of the\nABS system may have failed. This\ncould cause the rear wheels to skid\nor the vehicle to spin during braking\non a slippery road or hard braking ona dry paved road. If both warning\nlights come on, drive carefully, avoid-\ning hard braking as much as possi-ble, and ask your SUZUKI dealer to\ninspect the ABS system immediately.\n3-31OPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\n79K21-03EHow the ABS Works\nA computer continuously monitors wheel\nspeed. The computer compares the\nchanges in wheel speed when braking. If\nthe wheels slow suddenly, indicating askidding situation, the computer will\nchange braking pressure several times\neach second to prevent the wheels fromlocking. When you start your vehicle or\nwhen you accelerate after a hard stop, you\nmay hear a momentary motor or clickingsound as the system resets or checks\nitself.Electronic Stability Program \n(ESP\u00ae)\nESP\u00ae is a registered trademark of Daimler\nAG.\nThe Electronic Stability Program (ESP\u00ae)\nhelps to control the vehicle during corner-\ning if front wheels or rear wheels skid. Italso assists you in maintaining traction\nwhile accelerating on loose or slippery\nroad surfaces. It does this by regulating theengine\u2019s output, and by selectively apply-\ning the brakes. In addition, ESP\n\u00ae helps to\navoid skidding by controlling braking pres-\nsure.The ESP\u00ae has the following three systems:\nStability Control System\nThe vehicle stability control system helps\nprovide integrated co ntrol of systems such\nas anti-lock brakes, traction control, engine\ncontrol, etc. This  system automatically\ncontrols the brakes and engine to help pre-\nvent the vehicle from skidding when cor-\nnering on a slippery road surface or when\nturning the steering wheel abruptly.\nTraction Control System\nThe traction control system automatically\nhelps prevent the spinning of wheels whenthe vehicle is started or accelerated onslippery road surfaces. The system oper-\nates only if it senses that some of the\nwheels are spinning or beginning to losetraction. When this happens, the system\noperates the front or rear brakes and\nreduces engine power to limit wheel spin.\nNOTE:\nYou may hear a clicking sound in theengine compartment for a few seconds\nwhen you start the engine or just after the\nvehicle begins to move. This means thatthe above systems are in the self-check\nmode. This sound does not indicate a mal-\nfunction.WARNING\nThe ABS may not work properly if\ntires or wheels other than those\nspecified in the owner\u2019s manual areused. This is because the ABS works\nby comparing changes in wheel\nspeed. When repl acing tires or\nwheels, use only the size and type\nspecified in this owner\u2019s manual.WARNING\nThe ESP\u00ae cannot enhance the vehi-\ncle\u2019s driving stability in all situationsand does not control your vehicle\u2019s\nentire braking system. The ESP\n\u00ae can-\nnot prevent accidents, including\nthose resulting from excessive speed\nin turns, or hydroplaning. Only a safeand attentive driver can prevent acci-\ndents. The capabilities of an ESP\n\u00ae-\nequipped vehic le must never be used\nas a substitute for careful driving.\n3-32OPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\n79K21-03EAnti-Lock Braking System (ABS)\nABS will help you avoid skidding by elec-\ntronically controlling braking pressure. It\nwill also help you maintain steering control\nwhen braking on slippery surfaces or whenbraking hard. The ABS works automati-\ncally, so you do not have to use any specialbraking technique. Just push the brakepedal down without pumping. The ABS will\noperate whenever it senses that wheelsare locking up. You may feel the brakepedal pulsate while the ABS is operating.\n(For more information on ABS, see \u201cBrak-ing\u201d in the \u201cOPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\u201dsection.)\nNOTE:\nIf the ABS system is activated, you may\nhear a clunking noise and/or feel pulsating\nin the brake pedal. This is normal and indi-cates that the brake fluid pressure is being\ncontrolled properly.The ESP\n\u00ae indicator lights are described\nbelow:\nSLIP Indicator Light\n79K019\nThe SLIP indicator light in the instrument\ncluster blinks 5 times per second when one\nof the following systems is activated.\n\u007f Stability control system\u007f Traction control system\n\u007f Hill descent control system (if equipped)\nNOTE:\nWhen the SLIP indicator light comes onand stays on while driving, indicating a\nmalfunction of the ESP\n\u00ae systems (other\nthan ABS), the brake system will function\nas an ordinary ABS wi th no additional\nESP\u00ae functions.WARNING\n\u007f The ESP\u00ae may not work properly if\ntires or wheels other than thosespecified in the Owner\u2019s Manual are\nused.

A Tire Pressure MonitoringSystem (TPMS) sensor containing a\nunique identification code is mounted on\neach wheel. The TPMS sensors transmit\ntire pressure signals to a central receiver\nwhich relays the information to a tire pres-\nsure monitoring syst em controller. When\nthe inflation pressure of one or more tires\nindicates significant under-inflation, the low\ntire pressure warning light shown belowcomes on.\nNOTE:\nThe TPMS controller is not programmed to\nrecognize the ID code of the TPMS sensor\nin your spare tire. The tire pressure moni-toring system will only work with the spare\ntire if you bring your vehicle to an autho-\nrized SUZUKI dealer to register the IDcode of the spare tire sensor. Refer to\n\u201cReplacing Tires and/or Wheels\u201d in this\nsection.Low Tire Pressure Warning Light\n52D305\nWARNING\nEach tire, includin g the spare (if pro-\nvided), should be checked monthlywhen cold and inflated to the inflation\npressure recommended by the vehi-\ncle manufacturer on the vehicle plac-\nard or tire inflation pressure label. (Ifyour vehicle has tires of a different\nsize than the size  indicated on the\nvehicle placard or tire inflation pres-\nsure label, you should determine the\nproper tire inflation pressure for\nthose tires.)As an added safety feature, your\nvehicle has been equipped with a tire\npressure monitoring system (TPMS)that illuminates a low tire pressure\ntelltale when one or more of your\ntires is significantly under-inflated.\n(Continued)WARNING\n(Continued)Accordingly, when the low tire pres-sure telltale illuminates, you should\nstop and check your tires as soon as\npossible, and inflate them to theproper pressure.\nDriving on a significantly under-\ninflated tire causes the tire to over-heat and can lead to tire failure.\nUnder-inflation also reduces fuel effi-\nciency and tire tread life, and may\naffect the vehicl e\u2019s handling and\nstopping ability.Please note that the TPMS is not asubstitute for prop er tire mainte-\nnance, and it is th e driver\u2019s responsi-\nbility to mainta in correct tire\npressure, even if un der-inflation has\nnot reached the level to trigger illumi-nation of the TPMS low tire pressuretelltale.\n3-39OPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\n79K21-03EThe low tire pressure warning light can\ncome on due to normal causes such asnatural air leaks and pressure changes\ncaused by changes in temperature or\natmospheric pressure. Adjusting the airpressure in the tires to the pressure shownWARNING\nThe tire pressure monitoring systemis not a substitute  for regular tire\npressure inspections. Check tire\ninflation pressure s monthly when\ncold and set to the recommended\ninflation pressure as specified on the\nvehicle\u2019s tire information placard andin the owner\u2019s manual. Refer to\u201cTires\u201d in the \u201cINSPECTION AND\nMAINTENANCE\u201d section.\nWARNING\nIf the low tire pre ssure warning light\ndoes not come on when the ignition\nis turned to the \u201cON\u201d position, or\ncomes on and blinks while drivingthere may be a problem with the tirepressure monitori ng system. Have\nyour vehicle inspected by an autho-rized SUZUKI dealer. Even if the lightturns off after bl inking, indicating\nthat the monitoring system hasrecovered, make sure to have anauthorized SUZUKI dealer check the\nsystem.WARNING\nThe load rating of your tires isreduced at lower inflation pressures.If your tires become even moderately\nunder-inflated, the vehicle load may\nexceed the load rating of the tires,which can lead to tire failure. The low\ntire pressure warning light will not\nalert you of this condition. The warn-ing light will only come on when one\nor more of your tires become signifi-\ncantly under-inflated. Check andadjust your tire inflation pressure at\nleast once a month. Refer to \u201cTires\u201din the \u201cINSPECTION AND MAINTE-NANCE\u201d section.WARNING\nIf the low tire pre ssure warning light\ncomes on and stays on, reduce yourspeed and avoid abru pt steering and\nbraking. Stop in a safe place as soon\nas possible and check your tires.\u007f If you have a flat tire, replace it with\nthe spare tire. Refer to \u201cJackingInstructions\u201d in the \u201cEMERGENCYSERVICE\u201d section. Refer to\n\u201cReplacing Tires and/or Wheels\u201d\nfor instructions on how to restorenormal operation of the tire pres-\nsure monitoring system after you\nhave had a flat tire.\n\u007f If one or more of your tires is\nunder-inflated adjust the inflationpressure in all of your tires to therecommended inflation pressure as\nsoon as possible.\nBe aware that driving on a signifi-\ncantly under-inflated  tire can cause\nthe tire to overheat and can lead totire failure, and may affect steeringcontrol and brake effectiveness. This\ncould lead to an accident, resulting in\nsevere injury or death.\n3-40OPERATING YOUR VEHICLE\n79K21-03Eon the tire information placard should\ncause the low tire pressure warning light to\nturn off. \nIf the light turns on again shortly after\nadjusting the pressure in your tires, youmay have a flat tire. If you have a flat tire,\nreplace it with the spare tire. Refer to\n\u201cJacking Instructions\u201d in the \u201cEMER-GENCY SERVICE\u201d section. Refer to\n\u201cReplacing Tires and/or Wheels\u201d for\ninstructions on how to restore normal oper-ation of the tire pressure monitoring sys-\ntem after you have had a flat tire.\nNOTE:\n\u007f When the tire inflation pressure is\nadjusted in high altitude areas, the low\ntire pressure light may not turn off even\nafter tire inflation pressure adjustment.\nIn this case, adjust the inflation pressure\nto a slightly higher pressure than is\nshown on the tire information placard.\n\u007f The low tire pressure warning light may\nturn off temporarily after coming on. Thiscould be due to surface temperature\nincreases after long distance driving ortraveling to a high temperature area.\nEven if the tire pressure warning light\nturns off after coming on, make sure tocheck the inflation pressure of all tires.\n\u007f To reduce the chance that the low tire\npressure warning light will come on dueto normal changes in temperature and\natmospheric pressure, it is important to\ncheck and adjust the tire pressureswhen the tires are cold. Tires that\nappear to be at the specified pressurewhen checked after driving, when thetires are warm, could have pressure\nbelow the specification when the tires\ncool down. Also, tires that are inflated tothe specified pressure in a warm garage\nmay have pressure below the specifica-\ntion when the vehicle is driven outside invery cold temperature. If you adjust the\ntire pressure in a garage that is warmer\nthan the outside temperature, youshould add 1 psi to the recommended\ncold tire inflation pressure for every 10\u00b0F\ndifference between garage temperatureand outside temperature.\nFor tire inflation pressure information, referto \u201cTire Inflation Pre ssure\u201d in the \u201cINSPEC-\nTION AND MAINTENANCE\u201d section.\nTPMS Malfunction IndicatorWhen you turn off the engine, however, themalfunction indicator resets.

Specific design characteris-\ntics give them a higher center of gravity\nthan ordinary cars. An advantage of thehigher ground clearance is a better view of\nthe road allowing you to anticipate prob-\nlems. They are not designed for corneringat the same speed as conventional pas-\nsenger cars any more than low-slung\nsports cars are designed to perform satis-factorily under off-road conditions. If at all\npossible, avoid sharp turns or abrupt\nmaneuvers. As with other vehicles of thistype, failure to operate this vehicle cor-\nrectly may result in loss of control or vehi-\ncle rollover.\nMultipurpose vehicles have a significantly\nhigher rollover rate than other types ofvehicles.65D218\nIn a rollover crash, an unbelted person is\nsignificantly more likely to die than a per-\nson wearing a seat belt.\nImportant Differences Between \nYour Multipurpose Vehicle and \nOrdinary Passenger Cars\nHigher Ground Clearance\nThe higher ground clearance of your vehi-\ncle enables it to clear off-road obstacles,\nsuch as rocks and tree stumps, that ordi-nary passenger cars cannot drive over. An\nunavoidable result of this higher ground\nclearance is that the vehicle also has ahigher center of gravity. Consequently,\nyour vehicle will handle differently than a\nvehicle with a lower center of gravity.WARNING\n\u007f Wear Your Seat Belts at All Times.\nEven though air bags are equippedat the front seating  positions, the\ndriver and all passengers shouldbe properly restrained at all times,using the seat belts provided. Refer\nto the \u201cSeat Belts and Child\nRestraint Systems\u201d section forinstructions on proper use of the\nseat belts.\n\u007f Never drive whil e under the influ-\nence of alcohol or other drugs.Alcohol and drugs can seriously\nimpair your ability to drive safely,greatly increasing the risk of injury\nto yourself and others. You shouldalso avoid driving when you aretired, sick, irritated or under stress.\nWARNING\nYour multipurpose vehicle has han-\ndling characteristics that differ from\nthose of a conventional passengercar. For the safety of you and your\npassengers, please r ead the follow-\ning section very carefully.EXAMPLE\nImportant Vehicle Design Features To Know: NO\n4-2DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03EShorter Wheelbase\nAlong with its higher ground clearance,\nyour vehicle has a shorter wheelbase andshorter front and rear overhangs than\nmany passenger cars. These features\ncombine to allow you to drive your vehicleover hillcrests without hanging up on them\nor damaging the frame and chassis com-\nponents. The shorter wheelbase alsomakes the steering of your vehicle more\nresponsive than that of vehicles with longer\nwheelbases.\nNarrower Body Width and Track\nYour vehicle is narrower than the averagepassenger car so that  it can pass through\ntight spaces.\nWithout the essential characteristics\ndescribed above: higher ground clearance,\nshorter wheelbase and narrower bodywidth and track \u2013 your vehicle could not\nprovide you with excellent off road driving\nperformance. However, it is also true thaton-pavement driving, handling and steer-\ning will be different from what drivers expe-\nrience with a conventional passenger car.Break-In Catalytic Converter\n54G236\nThe purpose of the catalytic converter is tominimize the amount of harmful pollutantsin your vehicle\u2019s exhaust. Use of leaded\nfuel in vehicles equipped with catalytic\nconverters is prohibited by federal law,because lead deactivates the pollutant-\nreducing components of the catalyst sys-\ntem.\nThe converter is designed to last the life of\nthe vehicle under normal usage and whenunleaded fuel is used. No special mainte-\nnance is required on the converter. How-\never, it is very important to keep the engineproperly tuned. Engine misfiring, which\ncan result from an improperly tuned\nengine, may cause overheating of the cat-alyst. This may result in permanent heat\ndamage to the catalyst and other vehicle\ncomponents.CAUTION\nThe future performa nce and reliabil-\nity of the engine depends on the care\nand restraint exercised during itsearly life. It is especially important toobserve the following precautions\nduring the initial 960 km (600 miles)\nof vehicle operation.\n\u007f After starting, do not race the\nengine. Warm it up gradually.\n\u007f Avoid prolonged vehicle operation\nat a constant speed. Moving parts\nwill break in better if you vary your\nspeed.\n\u007f Start off from a stop slowly. Avoid\nfull throttle starts.\n\u007f Avoid hard stopping, especially\nduring the first 320 km (200 miles)\nof driving.\n\u007f Do not drive slowly with the trans-\nmission in a high gear.\n\u007f Drive the vehicle at moderate\nengine speeds.\n\u007f Do not tow a trailer during the first\n960 km (600 miles) of vehicle oper-\nation.EXAMPLEImportant Vehicle Design Features To Know: NO\nOn-Pavement Driving: NO\n4-3DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03E54G584SImproving Fuel Economy\nThe following instructions will help you\nimprove fuel economy.\nAvoid excessive idling\nIf you are to wait for more than a minutewhile you are parked, stop the engine and\nstart it again later. When warming up a\ncold engine, allow the engine to idle untilthe temperature gauge pointer comes up\nto the \u201cC\u201d position. In this position, the\nengine is sufficiently warm for starting off.\nAvoid \u201cjackrabbit\u201d starts\nFast starts away from lights or stop signswill consume fuel unnecessarily and\nshorten engine life. Start off slowly.\nAvoid unnecessary stops\nAvoid unnecessary deceleration and stop-\nping. Try to maintain a slow, steady speedwhenever possible. Slowing down and then\naccelerating again uses more fuel.\nKeep a steady cruising speed\nKeep as constant a speed as road and traf-\nfic conditions will permit.CAUTION\nTo minimize the possibility of catalystor other vehicle damage:\u007f Maintain the engine in the proper\noperating condition.\n\u007f In the event of an engine malfunc-\ntion, particularly one involving\nengine misfire or other apparent\nloss of performance, have the vehi-cle serviced promptly.\n\u007f Do not shut off the engine or inter-\nrupt the ignition when the transmis-\nsion is in gear and the vehicle is in\nmotion.\n\u007f Do not try to start the engine by\npushing or towing the vehicle orcoasting down a hill.\n\u007f Do not idle the engine with any\nspark plug wires disconnected orremoved, such as during diagnos-\ntic testing.\n\u007f Do not idle the vehicle for pro-\nlonged periods if idling seemsrough or there are other malfunc-tions.\n\u007f Do not allow the fuel tank to get\nnear the empty level.WARNING\nBe careful where you park and drive;the catalytic converter and otherexhaust components can get very\nhot. As with any vehicle, do not park\nor operate this ve hicle in areas where\ncombustible materials such as dry\ngrass or leaves can come in contact\nwith a hot exhaust system.\nOn-Pavement Driving: NO\nOff-Road Driving: NO\n4-4DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03EKeep the air cleaner clean\n60A183S\nIf the air cleaner is clogged with dust, there\nwill be greater intake resistance, resultingin decreased power output and increased\nfuel consumption.\nKeep weight to a minimum\nThe heavier the load, the more fuel the\nvehicle consumes. Take out any luggageor cargo when it is not necessary.\nKeep tire pressure correct\nUnderinflation of the tires can waste fuel\ndue to increased running resistance of the\ntires. Keep your tires inflated to the correctpressure shown on the label located below\nthe driver\u2019s side door latch striker.On-Pavement Driving\nGovernment data show that most rollover\naccidents for multi-purpose vehicles arecaused when a driver loses control of the\nvehicle and leaves the paved portion of the\nroadway striking a ditch, curb or other off-road object that causes the vehicle to over-\nturn. The following driving practices may\nreduce the risk of rollover.\nVehicle Slides Off-Road\nYou can reduce the risk of this kind of roll-over accident by always keeping the vehi-\ncle under control. Typically, drivers lose\ncontrol of vehicles, often resulting in roll-over accidents, when the driver is impaired\nbecause of alcohol or other drugs, falls\nasleep at the wheel or is otherwise inatten-tive, or is driving too fast for the road condi-\ntions.\nRollovers On the Roadway\nIf, for any reason, your vehicle slides side-\nways or spins out of control at highwayspeeds, while on the paved portion of the\nroadway, the risk of rollover is greatly\nincreased. This condition can be createdwhen two or more wheels drop off onto the\nshoulder and you steer sharply in an\nattempt to reenter the roadway. To reducethe risk of rollover in these circumstances,\nif conditions permit, you should hold the\nsteering wheel firmly and slow downbefore pulling back into the travel lanes\nwith controlled steering movements.All Types of Rollover AccidentsAs with many kinds of automobile acci-\ndents, rollovers can be greatly reduced bydoing what all prudent drivers should do,\ni.e., don\u2019t drink and drive, don\u2019t drive when\ntired and don\u2019t do anything behind thewheel that could cause a loss of attention\nto the driving task.\nAdditional guidelines are set out below for\nyour on-road driving.\nKnow Your Vehicle\nTake time to familiarize yourself with the\nunique handling characteristics of yourvehicle by first driving around in an area\naway from traffic. Practice turning the vehi-\ncle at a variety of speeds and in differentdirections. Get a feel for the greater steer-\ning response that your vehicle has over a\nconventional car.\nWear Your Seat Belts at All Times\nThe driver and all passengers should beproperly restrained at all times, using the\nseat belts provided. Refer to the \u201cSeat\nBelts and Child Restraint Systems\u201d sectionfor instructions on pr oper use of the seat\nbelts.\nEXAMPLEOff-Road Driving: NO\n4-5DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03EDon\u2019t Make Sharp Turns\nAs mentioned before, small multipurpose\nvehicles have specific design characteris-tics that allow them to perform in a wide\nvariety of applications. These characteris-\ntics also change the cornering behaviorrelative to conventional passenger cars.\nRemember, small multipurpose vehicles\nhave more responsive steering and ahigher center of gravity than conventional\npassenger cars. If at all possible, avoid\nmaking sharp turns in your vehicle.\nSlow Down on Curves\nLearn to approach curves cautiously andat a conservative speed. Do not attempt to\ntake curves at the same speeds that you\nwould in a vehicle with a lower center ofgravity. Just as you would not drive a\nsports car on a trail, you should not\nattempt to drive your vehicle around curveslike a sports car.\nSlow Down and Use Caution on Slip-\npery Roads\nUnder wet road conditions you should\ndrive at a lower speed than on dry roadsdue to possible slippage of tires during\nbraking. When driving on icy, snowcovered\nor muddy roads, reduce your speed andavoid sudden acceleration, abrupt braking\nor sharp steering movements. Use 4-wheel\ndrive high range (4H) (if equipped) for bet-ter traction.NOTE:Avoid operating your vehicle in \u201c4H LOCK\u201d\nor \u201c4L LOCK\u201d on wet pavement as much\nas possible. Operating your vehicle in \u201c4HLOCK\u201d or \u201c4L LOCK\u201d on wet pavement\nmay cause severe damage to the drive\ntrain.\nNOTE:\nOperating your vehicle in \u201c4H\u201d on dry andtight corner may cause some vibration on\nyour vehicle. This is not caused by the\nvehicle malfunction, but caused by workingof the limited slip differential gear in the\ncenter differential.CAUTION\nDo not operate your vehicle in \u201c4H\nLOCK\u201d or \u201c4L LOCK\u201d on dry, hardsurfaces. Operating your vehicle in\n\u201c4H LOCK\u201d or \u201c4L LOCK\u201d on dry,\nhard surfaces puts severe stress tothe drive train, especi ally during tight\ncornering, and can damage it. Also,you may have some difficulty steer-ing.CAUTION\nUnevenly worn tires can cause prob-lems in the operat ion of the transfer\nswitch. Be sure to rotate the tires\naccording to the maintenance sched-\nule. Refer to \u201cTires\u201d and \u201cMainte-nance Schedule\u201d in the\n\u201cINSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE\u201d\nsection for proper tire rotation proce-dures.Off-Road Driving: NO\n4-6DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03EOff-Road Driving\nYour vehicle has specific design character-\nistics for off-road driving. When you leavethe pavement, you will encounter driving\nsurfaces of all kinds which may change\ncontinually as you drive. In most cases, off-road driving requires the use of 4-wheel\ndrive. If your vehicle is a 2-wheel drive\nvehicle, you should limit your off-road driv-ing only to hard, flat, nonslippery surfaces.\n2-wheel drive vehicles have far less trac-\ntion on off-road surfaces than 4-wheeldrive vehicles. It is important when driving\noff-road to follow the guidelines below.\nUse Caution on Steep Inclines\nAlways inspect hills be fore you attempt to\ndrive up them. Know what is on the other\nside and how you will get back down. If you\nhave any doubt that it is safe, do not\nattempt to drive over a hill. Never driveyour vehicle up an extremely steep incline.\nComing down a steep hill can be trickier\nthan getting up one. Keep the vehicle\nheading straight down the hill and use low\ngear. Do not lock the brakes. If the vehiclebegins to slide, accelerate slightly to regain\nsteering control.Do Not Turn on or Drive Across the Sideof Hills\nTurning on or driving across the side of ahill can be extremely hazardous. Most of\nthe vehicle\u2019s weight will be transferred to\nthe downhill tires, which could result in thevehicle rolling sideways. Whenever possi-\nble, avoid this potential hazard. Also, if you\nhave to exit your vehicle on a side-hill,always get out on the uphill side.\nWear Your Seat Belts at All Times\nYou and your passengers should use the\nseat belts at all times when driving off-\nroad. For proper seat belt use, refer to the\u201cSeat Belts and Child Restraint Systems\u201d\nsection in this manual.\nAvoid Sudden Reactions in Mud, Ice or\nSnow\nBe careful when off-road conditions areslick. Reduce your speed and avoid sud-\nden movements of the vehicle. If your vehi-\ncle is a 2-wheel drive vehicle, do not drivein deep snow or mud. If your vehicle is a 4-\nwheel drive vehicle, be aware that driving\nin deep snow or mud can cause a loss oftraction and an increase in the resistance\nto the vehicle\u2019s forward motion. Use 4WD\nlow gear (4L) and maintain a steady butmoderate speed with a light touch on the\nsteering wheel and brakes.Do not drive in the field covered withgrown grass\nIf you drive in the field covered with grass,it may cause unexpected accident or vehi-\ncle damage by getting caught in grown\ngrass.\nIf Your Vehicle Gets Stuck\nIf your vehicle gets stuck in snow, mud orsand, follow the directions below:\n1) (For vehicles equipped with transfer\nswitch) Turn the transfer switch to \u201c4H\nLOCK\u201d or \u201c4L LOCK\u201d.\n2) Shift the transmission back and forth\nbetween a forward range (or first gearfor manual transmission) and reverse.\nThis will create a rocking motion which\nmay give you enough momentum tofree the vehicle. Press gently on the\naccelerator to keep wheel spin to a min-\nimum. Remove your foot from theaccelerator while shifting. \nDo not race the engine. Excessive\nwheel spin will cause the tires to digdeeper, making it more difficult to free\nthe vehicle.\n3) If your vehicle remains stuck after a few\nminutes of rocking, get another vehicleto pull you out.\n4-7DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03ETire Chains\nTire chains should only be used if they are\nneeded to increase traction or are required\nby law. Make sure that the chains you use\nare small-link chains or cable-type chainsand are the correct size for your vehicle\u2019s\ntires. Also make sure that there is enough\nclearance between the fenders and thechains as installed on the tires.\nInstall the chains on the rear tires tightly,\naccording to the chain manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. Retight en the chains after\ndriving about 1.0 km (1/2 mile) if neces-\nsary. With the chains installed, drive slowly.Do not drive throug h deep or rushing\nwaterDriving in deep or rushing water can behazardous. You could lose control of the\nvehicle and the occupants could drown.\nAlso, your vehicle could be seriously dam-aged. To avoid these risks, observe the fol-\nlowing instructions and precautions.\n\u007f Do not drive through deep or rushing\nwater. Deep or rushing water, such as\nfast-moving streams or floodwaters,could carry your vehicle away from your\nintended path. The water is too deep if it\ncovers your wheel hubs, axles orexhaust tailpipe. Know the depth of the\nwater before you attempt to drive\nthrough it.\n\u007f If water blocks the tailpipe, the engine\nmay not start or run. If the water is deepenough to get drawn into the engineintake system, the engine will be badly\ndamaged.\n\u007f Submerged brakes will have poor brak-\ning performance. Drive slowly and care-fully. Driving slowly will also help avoid\nwater splashing onto the ignition system,\nwhich could cause the engine to stall.\n\u007f Even when driving through shallow or\nstill waters, drive carefully since thewater may be hiding ground hazards\nsuch as holes, ditches or bumps.WARNING\n\u007f Do not allow anyone to stand near\nthe vehicle when you are rocking it,\nand do not spin the wheels faster\nthan an indicated 40 km/h (25 mph)\non the speedometer. Personalinjury and/or vehicle damage may\nresult from spinning the wheels too\nfast.\n\u007f Be sure to turn the transfer switch\nfrom \u201c4H\u201d to \u201c4H LOCK\u201d or \u201c4LLOCK\u201d when the tires slip in \u201c4H\u201d. The continuing tires slip in \u201c4H\u201d\ncan cause the limite d slip differen-\ntial gear damage in the center dif-\nferential.\nCAUTION\nRelease the accelerator pedal when\noperating the gearshift lever. Operat-\ning the lever with the engine racing\ncan damage the gears.\nCAUTION\nDo not continue rocking the vehicle\nfor more than a few minutes. Pro-\nlonged rocking can cause engine\noverheating, transmission or trans-\nfer case damage or tire damage.CAUTION\nIf you hear the chains hitting against\nthe vehicle body while driving, stop\nand tighten them.\n4-8DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03EWARNING\nIn addition to following the driving\ntips in this section, it is important toobserve the following precautions for\non-road and off-road driving.\n\u007f Driver and passen gers should wear\nseat belts at all times.\n\u007f Do not let anyone else drive your\nvehicle unless they are also awareof the vehicle characteristics and\nhandling differences described in\nthis section.\n\u007f Avoid loaning your vehicle to any-\none unless you accompany them.\n\u007f Make sure your tires are in good\ncondition and always maintain the\nspecified tire pressure. Refer to\n\u201cTires\u201d in the \u201cINSPECTION ANDMAINTENANCE\u201d section for\ndetails.\n\u007f Do not use tires other than those\nspecified by SUZUKI. Never use dif-ferent sizes or types of tires on the\nfront and rear wheels. For informa-tion regarding the specified tires,\nrefer to the Tire Inflation Pressure\nLabel located on the driver\u2019s sidedoor pillar or the \u201cSPECIFICA-\nTIONS\u201d section.\n(Continued)WARNING\n(Continued)\u007f Never use oversized tires or special\nshocks and springs to raise (jack\nup) your vehicle. This will raise the\ncenter of gravity of the vehicle andchange its handling characteris-\ntics. Oversized tires may also rub\nagainst the fender over bumps,causing vehicle damage or tire fail-\nure.\n\u007f After driving through water, mud or\nsandy ground, test the brakes whiledriving at a slow speed to see if\nthey have mainta ined their normal\neffectiveness. If the brakes are less\neffective than normal, dry them by\nrepeatedly appl ying the brakes\nwhile driving slowly until the\nbrakes have regained their normal\neffectiveness.\n\u007f Do not use \u201c4H LOCK\u201d or \u201c4L\nLOCK\u201d drive for normal driving.\n\u007f After extended operation in mud,\nsand or water, have the brakes\ninspected by your authorized\nSUZUKI dealer as  soon as possi-\nble.\n4-9DRIVING TIPS\n79K21-03EMEMO\nOTHER CONTROLS AND EQUIPMENT\n5\n79K21-03E60G407OTHER CONTROLS AND EQUIPMENT\nAutomatic Heating and Ai r Conditioning System \n(Climate Control) .................................................................5-1\nRadio Antenna .....................................................................5-8Audio Systems (Type A) .....................................................5-8Audio Systems (Type B) .....................................................5-36Fuel Filler Cap .....................................................................5-62Engine Hood ........................................................................5-63Sun Visor .............................................................................5-64Interior Light Switch ...........................................................5-64Luggage Compartment Light .............................................5-65Spot Light ............................................................................5-66Accessory Socket (if eq uipped) ........ .................................5-66\nCigarette Lighter and Ashtray (if equipped) .....................5-67Sunroof (if equipped) ..........................................................5-68Assist Grips (if equipped) ..................................................5-70Coat Hooks (if equipped) ....................................................5-70Glove Box ............................................................................5-71Overhead Console Box (if equipped) ................................5-71Cup Holder and Storage Bin (if equipped) ........................5-72Front Seat Back Pocket (if equipped) ...............................5-73Shopping Hook (if equipped) .............................................5-73Armrest ................................................................................5-73Floor Mats (if equipped) .....................................................5-74Luggage Compartment Cover ............................................5-74Underfloor Bins (if equipped) ............................................5-77Luggage Restraint Loops (if equipped) ............................5-78Roof Rails or Roof Rack Anchor s (if equipped) ...............5-78\nHomeLink\u00ae (if equipped) ....................................................5-80Frame Hooks .......................................................................5-83\n5-1OTHER CONTROLS AND EQUIPMENT\n79K21-03EAutomatic Heating and Ai r Conditioning System \n(Climate Control)\nAir Outlet\n66J2501\n1 2\n2\n33\n55\n554EXAMPLE1.

To help maintain opti-mum performance and durability of your air\nconditioner, it needs to be run periodically.\nOperate the air condit ioner at least once a\nmonth for one minute with the engine\nidling. This circulates the refrigerant and oil\nand helps protect the internal components.\nYour air conditioner is equipped with air fil-ters. Clean or replace them as specified inthe \u201cMaintenance Schedule\u201d in the\n\u201cINSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE\u201d sec-\ntion. Have this job done by your SUZUKIdealer as the lower glove box must be low-\nered for this job.\nNOTE:\nYour vehicle uses the air conditioning\nrefrigerant HFC-134a, commonly called\u201cR-134a\u201d. R-134a replaced R-12 around\n1993 for automotive applications. Other\nrefrigerants are available, including recy-cled R-12, but only R-134a should be used\nin your vehicle.(F)\n(G)\nEXAMPLE\nCAUTION\nUsing the wrong refrigerant may\ndamage your air conditioning sys-\ntem.

To reduce the chancethat the low tire pressure warning lightwill come on due to normal changes intemperature and atmospheric pres-sure, it is important to check andadjust the tire pressures when the tiresare cold. Tires that appear to be at thespecified pressure when checked afterdriving, when the tires are warm, couldhave pressure below the specificationwhen the tires cool down. Also, tiresthat are inflated to the specified pres-sure in a warm garage may have pres-sure below the specification when thevehicle is driven outside in very coldtemperature. If you adjust the tirepressure in a garage that is warmerthan the outside temperature, youshould add 1 psi to the recommendedcold tire inflation pressure for every10\u00b0F difference between garage tem-perature and outside temperature.\nMeasuring air pressure\nUse the following steps to achieveproper tire inflation:1) Identify the recommended tire pres-\nsure on the vehicle\u2019s Tire and Load-ing Information Label or in theowner\u2019s manual.\n2) Remove the valve cap from the tire\nvalve stem.\n3) Using a reliable pressure gauge,\nmeasure the tire inflation pressureby pressing the tire gauge firmlyonto the valve to get a pressuremeasurement.

Thefollowing information will help youunderstand the grading system, whichapplies to vehicles sold in the U.S.Consult your SUZUKI dealer or tireretailer for help in choosing the correctreplacement tires for your vehicle.\nQuality grades can be found where\napplicable on the tire sidewall betweentread shoulder and maximum sectionwidth. For example:\nTreadwear 200 Traction AA Tempera-\nture A\nDOT Quality Grades\nTreadwear\nTraction AA A B C\nTemperature A B C\nAll Passenger Car Tires Must Conform\nTo Federal Safety Requirements inAddition To These Grades\nTreadwear\nThe treadwear grade is a comparativerating based on the wear rate of thetire when tested under controlled con-ditions on a specified government testcourse. For example, a tire graded 150would wear one and one-half (1 1/2)times as well on the governmentcourse as a tire graded 100. The rela-tive performance of tires dependsupon the actual conditions of their use,however and may depart significantlyfrom the norm due to variations in driv-ing habits, service practices and differ-ences in road characteristics andclimate.\nTraction \u2013 AA, A, B, C\nThe traction grades, from highest tolowest, are AA, A, B and C. Thosegrades represent the tire\u2019s ability tostop on wet pavement as measuredunder controlled conditions on speci-fied government test surfaces ofasphalt and concrete. A tire marked Cmay have poor traction performance.Temperature \u2013 A, B, CThe temperature grades are A (thehighest), B and C, representing thetire\u2019s resistance to the generation ofheat and its ability to dissipate heat\nwhen tested under controlled condi-tions on a specified indoor laboratorytest wheel. Sustained high tempera-ture can cause the material of the tireto degenerate and reduce tire life, andexcessive temperature can lead tosudden tire failure. The grade C corre-sponds to a level of performancewhich all passenger car tires mustmeet under the Federal Motor VehicleSafety Standard No. 109. Grades Band A represent higher levels of per-formance on the laboratory test wheelthan the minimum required by law.\nWARNING\nThe traction grade assigned tothis tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, anddoes not include acceleration,cornering, hydroplaning or peaktraction characteristics.WARNING\nThe temperature grade for thistire is established for a tire that isproperly inflated and not over-loaded. Excessive speed, under-inflation or excessive loading,either separately or in combina-tion, can cause heat buildup andpossible tire failure.Tires: 6\n7-31INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE\n79K21-03ETire Rotation\n4-tire rotation\n65D459\nTo avoid uneven wear of your tires and\nto prolong their life, rotate the tires asillustrated. Tires sh ould be rotated as\nrecommended in the periodic mainte-nance schedule. After rotation, adjustfront and rear tire pressures to thespecification listed on your vehicle\u2019sTire and Loading Information Label.WARNING\nRust or dirt on a wheel, or on theparts to which it is fastened, canmake wheel nuts become looseafter a time.

To measure the weight andload, try making your vehicle to a high-way weighing station, shipping com-pany or inspection station for trucks,etc. Compare these weights to theGVWR and GAWR (front and rear)listed on the Safety Certification Label.If the gross vehicle weight or the loadon either axle exceeds these ratings,you must remove enough weight tobring the load down to the ratedcapacity.\nSteps for Determining Correct LoadLimit1) Locate the statement \u201cThe com-\nbined weight of occupants andcargo should never exceed XXX kgor XXX lbs\u201d on your vehicle\u2019s plac-ard.\n2) Determine the combined weight of\nthe driver and pa ssengers that will\nbe riding in your vehicle.\n3) Subtract the combined weight of\nthe driver and passengers fromXXX kg or XXX lbs.\n4) The resulting figure equals the\navailable amount of cargo and lug-gage load capacity. For example, ifthe \u201cXXX\u201d amount equals 1400 lbsand there will be five 150 lb passen-\nWARNING\nNever overload your vehicle.Overloading your vehicle cancause damage to your tires andlead to poor steering and brakingwhich can result in an accident.The gross vehicle weight (sum ofthe weights of the loaded vehicle,driver and passengers) mustnever exceed the Gross VehicleWeight Rating (GVWR) listed onthe Safety Certification Label. Inaddition, never distribute a loadso that the weight on either thefront or rear axle exceeds theGross Axle Weight Rating(GAWR) listed on the Safety Certi-fication Label.WARNING\n\u007f Always distribute cargo evenly.\n\u007f To avoid personal injury or\ndamage to your vehicle, always\nsecure cargo to prevent it from\nshifting if the vehicle movessuddenly.\n\u007f Place heavier objects on the\nfloor and as far forward in thecargo area as possible. Never\npile cargo higher than the top of\nthe seatbacks.Fuses: 7\n7-35INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE\n79K21-03Egers in your vehicle, the amount of\navailable cargo and luggage loadcapacity is 650 lbs (1400 \u2013 750 (5 x150) = 650 lbs).\n5) Determine the combined weight of\nluggage and cargo being loaded onthe vehicle. That weight may notsafely exceed the available cargoand luggage load capacity calcu-lated in Step 4.\n6) If your vehicle will be towing a\ntrailer, load from your trailer will betransferred to your vehicle. Consultthis manual to determine how thisreduces the available cargo andluggage load capacity of your vehi-cle.\nVehicle Loading ExampleAs an example, suppose that the Tireand Loading Information label on yourvehicle indicates that your vehicle\u2019stotal load capacity is 950 lbs. If youwere to drive your vehicle with onepassenger, and the total combinedweight of you and your passenger was350 lbs, then the cargo and luggagecapacity of your vehicle would be 600lbs (950 \u2013 350 = 600 lbs).If you later added 2 more passengers,having a combined weight of 325 lbs,the cargo and luggage capacity ofyour vehicle would be reduced from600 lbs to 275 lbs (600 \u2013 325 = 275lbs). As you can see, as the numberand combined weight of vehicle occu-pants increase, the vehicle\u2019s cargoand luggage capacity decreases.Suppose again, that you were to takea trip in your vehicle with the samethree passengers described above,and you decided to tow a trailer havinga trailer tongue weight of 75 lbs. Thecargo and luggage capacity would bereduced again, to 200 lbs (275 \u2013 75 =200 lbs).\nDetermining Compatibility of Tire\nand Vehicle Load LimitsThe tires on your vehicle, when theyare inflated to the recommended tireinflation pressure, have a load-carry-ing capacity that is greater than theload that will be on the tires when thevehicle is at its GVWR or GAWR limit.Never use replacement tires that havea load-carrying capacity less than theoriginal tires on your vehicle. Tire load-carrying capacity information ismolded into the tire sidewall typicallyshown as \u201cMax. Load\u201d. Use of replace-ment tires with a lower load-carryingcapacity than the original tires, or fail-ure to keep the tires inflated to recom-mended tire pressure, may reduce theGVWR or GAWR limit of your vehicle.NOTE:Use of replacement tires with a higherload-carrying capacity than the origi-nal tires, or using a tire inflation pres-sure higher than the recommendedtire inflation pre ssure, will not increase\nthe GVWR or GAWR limit of your vehi-cle.\nFuses: 7\nHeadlight Aiming: Bulb Replacement: 7\n7-36INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE\n79K21-03EBattery\n60A269\nYour vehicle is equipped with a battery that\nrequires infrequent maintenance.

Please read and follow these instructions\ncarefully.\nImportant Information About Corro-\nsion\nCommon causes of corrosion\n1) Accumulation of road salt, dirt, moisture\nor chemicals in hard-to-reach areas ofthe vehicle underbody or frame.\n2) Chipping, scratches and any damage to\ntreated or painted metal surfacesresulting from minor accidents orimpact from stones and gravel.\nEnvironmental conditions which accel-erate corrosion\n1) Road salt, dust control chemicals, sea\nair or industrial pollution will all acceler-\nate the corrosion of metal.\n2) High humidity will increase the rate of\ncorrosion particularly when the temper-ature range is just above the freezing\npoint.\n3) Moisture in certain areas of a vehicle\nfor an extended period of time may pro-mote corrosion even though other body\nsections may be completely dry.\n4) High temperatures will cause an accel-\nerated rate of corrosion to parts of thevehicle which are not well ventilated to\npermit quick drying.\n52D151\nThis information illustrates the necessity of\nkeeping your vehicle (particularly the\nunderbody) as clean and dry as possible. It\nis equally important to repair any damageto the paint or protective coatings as soon\nas possible.\nHow to Help Prevent Corrosion\nWash your vehicle frequentlyThe best way to preserve the finish on your\nvehicle and to help avoid corrosion is tokeep it clean with frequent washing.\nWash your vehicle at least once during the\nwinter and once immediately after the win-\nter. Keep your vehicle, particularly the\nunderside, as clean and dry as possible.If you frequently drive on salted roads, your\nvehicle should be washed at least once a\nmonth during the winter. If you live near theocean, your vehicle should be washed at\nleast once a month throughout the year.\nWash your vehicle immediately after using\nit off-road. For washin g instructions, refer\nto the \u201cVehicle Cleaning\u201d section.\nRemove foreign material deposits\nForeign material such as salts, chemicals,road oil or tar, tree sap, bird droppings and\nindustrial fall-out may damage the finish of\nyour vehicle if it is left on painted surfaces.Remove these types of deposits as quickly\nas possible. If these deposits are difficult to\nwash off, an additional cleaner may berequired. Be sure that any cleaner you use\nis not harmful to painted surfaces and is\nspecifically intended for your purposes.Follow the manufacturer\u2019s directions when\nusing these special cleaners.\nWARNING\nForeign material can lodge betweenthe fuel tank of your vehicle and the\nskid plate which covers it. You shouldperiodically clean out any foreign\nmaterial which has accumulated in\nthis area, since it could create a firehazard. Corrosion Prevention: 5\n9-2APPEARANCE CARE\n79K21-03ERepair finish damage\nCarefully examine your vehicle for damage\nto the painted surfaces, especially if it isused off-road. Should you find any chips or\nscratches in the paint, touch them up\nimmediately to prevent corrosion fromstarting. If the chips or scratches have\ngone through to the bare metal, have a\nqualified body shop make the repair.\nKeep passenger and cargo compart-\nments cleanMoisture, dirt or mud can accumulate\nunder the floor mats and may cause corro-\nsion. Occasionally, check under thesemats to ensure that this area is clean and\ndry. More frequent checks are necessary if\nthe vehicle is used off road or in wetweather.\nCertain cargo such as chemicals, fertiliz-\ners, cleaners, salts, etc. are extremely cor-\nrosive by nature. These products should\nbe transported in sealed containers. If aspill or leak does occur, clean and dry the\narea immediately.\nUse mud and gravel shields\nThe use of mud and gravel shields will help\nprotect your vehicle, especially if you fre-quently drive on gravel or salted roads.\nFull-size shields, which extend as close to\nthe road as is practical, are the best. Thefittings for such shields should also be cor-\nrosion resistant. Please check with yourauthorized SUZUKI dealer for informationon these shields.\nStore your vehicle in a dry, well-venti-\nlated area\nDo not park your vehicle in a damp, poorlyventilated area. If you often wash your\nvehicle in the garage or if you frequently\ndrive it in when wet, your garage may bedamp. The high humidity in the garage\nmay cause or accelerate corrosion. A wet\nvehicle may corrode even in a heatedgarage if the ventilation is poor.Cover your vehicle\n50G203\nIf you cannot regularly park your vehicle ina garage, we recommend you use a vehi-cle cover. Years of exposure to midday sun\ncan cause the colors in paint, plastic parts\nand fabrics to fade. Covering your vehiclewith a high-quality, \u201cbreathable\u201d vehicle\ncover can help protect the finish from the\nharmful UV rays in sunlight, and canreduce the amount of dust and air pollution\nreaching the surface. Your SUZUKI dealer\ncan help you select the right cover for yourvehicle.WARNING\nDo not apply additional undercoatingor rust preventive coating on or\naround exhaust system components\nsuch as the catalytic converter,exhaust pipes, etc. A fire could be\nstarted if the undercoating substance\nbecomes overheated.\nCorrosion Prevention: 5\n9-3APPEARANCE CARE\n79K21-03EVehicle Cleaning\n76G044S\nCleaning Interior\nVinyl upholstery\nPrepare a solution of soap or mild deter-\ngent mixed with warm water.
