### Project Section:
```
AutoQuery - AI-Powered Document Q&A Chatbot          June 2025 – July 2025

• Built an AI chatbot using React, TypeScript, and FastAPI that enables 
  natural language queries on uploaded documents
  
• Integrated OpenAI GPT-4 API with LangChain for intelligent, context-aware 
  responses with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
  
• Implemented FAISS vector store for efficient semantic document search 
  across PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
  
• Designed responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn-ui components, 
  featuring real-time chat and document management
  
• Developed RESTful API with FastAPI for document processing pipeline 
  including text extraction, chunking, and embedding generation

Tech Stack: React, TypeScript, Python, FastAPI, OpenAI API, LangChain, 
FAISS, Tailwind CSS

## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### Opening Statement:
> "I built AutoQuery, an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to upload documents and ask questions about them in natural language. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4 for intelligent responses and FAISS for efficient document retrieval."

### Technical Deep-Dive (If Asked):
> "The system follows a RAG architecture. When users upload documents, I extract text using PyPDF2 or python-docx, chunk it into manageable pieces, and convert each chunk to vector embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model. These are stored in a FAISS vector database. When users ask questions, I perform similarity search to find relevant chunks and send them to GPT-4 along with the question for context-aware responses."

### Why This Tech Stack:
> "I chose React with TypeScript for the frontend because it provides type safety and better developer experience. FastAPI for the backend because it's modern, fast, and perfect for AI projects with excellent async support. LangChain simplified the document processing pipeline, and FAISS provides production-grade vector search."

### Challenges Faced:
> "The main challenge was optimizing document chunking - balancing chunk size to maintain context while keeping searches fast. I also had to handle various document formats reliably and ensure the embedding generation didn't timeout on large files."
